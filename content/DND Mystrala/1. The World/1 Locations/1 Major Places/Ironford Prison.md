## History
[[Gunner Ironford]] is the self-proclaimed ruler.

Prisoners are dropped of by ship on the North End. Overall self regulating since there is no escape. 

## Other General Notes
All prisoners receive an enchanted tattoo that prevents any divination magic from reaching them, unless the caster also has an enchanted tattoo, then they are automatically able to use divination magic against another tattoo wearer.
