#### Etherium District
Etherium District: Home of the Valendrians research and development division. A three leveled tower with various teleportation runes (powered by an unknown type of aggressive magic) and an arcane engine on the ground floor. The upper areas of the tower appear to be a dome that has been exploded and frozen in time, in a similar but more purposeful manner than Faraday's tower. The area hums with magical energy and there was once a ward protecting the area from the Phaerimm attack on magical energy. The ward itself was powered by the arcane engines on the ground floor but generated by a magical clockwork device (that Sundara is able to detect is from another plane) accessible only via the teleportation runes on a higher floor. Valendrian elves would find themselves "stationed" in the district before its fall during Sundara and the groups visit.

## History
Secretive city of elves atop the Skyshattered Isles that were previously thought to be unpopulated. The last vestige of  those who had survived the Spellplague.

Elaine Valender, the godfather of Valendri, united multiple elf societies to rival Nethero. Valender collected forgotten lore and sought knowledge from the outer planes. He tried to create a plan of pure order and harmony. In doing so contacted [[Mechanus]]. Certain offspring are blessed with some of the same power.

## Other General Notes
Currently suffering from a blight suspected to be caused by the reappearance of The [[Phaerimm]] feeding off of the archotech that supports the islands. They have created a system of tunnels below the city and also have a central hive where the queen resides. The Nexus Battery and the Phaerimm Queen have fused into one being.
