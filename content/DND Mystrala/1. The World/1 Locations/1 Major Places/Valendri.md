## History
Secretive city of elves atop the Skyshattered Isles that were previously thought to be unpopulated. The last vestige of  those who had survived the Spellplague.

Elaine Valender, the godfather of Valendri, united multiple elf societies to rival Nethero. Valender collected forgotten lore and sought knowledge from the outer planes. He tried to create a plan of pure order and harmony. In doing so contacted [[Mechanus]]. Certain offspring are blessed with some of the same power.

## Other General Notes
Currently suffering from a blight suspected to be caused by the reappearance of The [[Phaerimm]] feeding off of the archotech that supports the islands. They have created a system of tunnels below the city and also have a central hive where the queen resides.
