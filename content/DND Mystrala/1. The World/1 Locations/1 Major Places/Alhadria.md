## Notable Characters
- Ishmael and Daveed travelled to Alhadria after the death of Daveed's mother, Nadia

## History
Alhadria used to be filled with Far Travelers. Malak, who was a child about 300 years ago, left another continent and brought his people to the [[Delmiri Desert]] to become 'awakened.' He and his people massacred the travelers in Alhadria and created their own settlement.

Very xenophobic, likely to murder any outsiders that do not have a reason to be there, they brand and exile any smugglers.

## Other General Notes
Speak Delmiri (a language similar to elven). Rumors that they harvest people for money.
