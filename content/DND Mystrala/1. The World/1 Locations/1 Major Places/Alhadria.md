**Alhadria - very xenophobic magical elf city in the desert, does not have extradition treaty with Ironford Prison**

Alhadria - speak Delmiri (similar to elven), very xenophobic, kill other people who aren’t Delmiri and brand and exile smugglers, some harvest people for money? Alhadria used to be filled with Far Travelers. Malak (was a child at the time, 300 years ago) came from another continent to be, “awoken.” Him and his people massacred the Far Empire people and created their own settlement.

**The Prophet - ?Important figure in Alhadria**
