## History
Previously under the "protection" of a pirate clan, but the [[Sea of Swords]] hosted at The [[Mortal Promise]] took over and were considered protectors of the area. [[The Merchant Consortium]] hosted at the Golden Quill seems to be a contentious entity in the city, making some people rather wealthy but despised by the [[Restore Family|Undertavern]]. Overall the city has been attacked multiple times in the last few years.

The [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] was destroyed by a portal to the elemental plane of fire and with the city under attack, Lord [[Oswald Beaumont]] and his army of Clockwork Sentinels took over the city. The Clockwork Consortium, the only engineer guild in the city, hires primarily gnomes and were in charge of creating more [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinels]] at a factory in the industrial district. The city was tense for some time under the strict rule of Oswald Beaumont, The Remnants tried inciting rebellion unsuccessfully a couple of time.

Rule of New Calim was secretly transferred from [[Oswald Beaumont]] to [[Dunspero Beaumont]] after The Remnants killed Oswald Beaumont outside of his home The Whispering Tower. [[Gunner Ironford]] sailed to New Calim with an armada of ships and destroyed the city with powerful cannon attacks. The Remnants, the [[Sea of Swords]], and the Clockwork Sentinels fought back and drove Gunner and his fleet away. Dunspero's power continues to grow as [[The Merchant Consortium]] is in the process of placing her in a role to make unilateral decisions for the city. She is now known as the High Chancellor of New Calim. Sarah notes that since she took power in conjunction with the Clockwork Sentinels have cracked down to bring order to the city.
