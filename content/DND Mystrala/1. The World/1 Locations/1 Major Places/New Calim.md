## History
Previously under the "protection" of a pirate clan, but the [[Sea of Swords]] hosted at The [[Mortal Promise]] took over and were considered protectors of the area. [[The Merchant Consortium]] hosted at the Golden Quill seems to be a contentious entity in the city, making some people rather wealthy but despised by the [[Restore Family|Undertavern]]. 

The [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] was destroyed by a portal to the elemental plane of fire and with the city under attack, Lord [[Oswald Beaumont]] and his army of Clockwork Sentinels took over the city. The Clockwork Consortium, the only engineer guild in the city, hires primarily gnomes and were in charge of creating more [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinels]] at a factory in the industrial district. The city was tense for some time under the strict rule of Oswald Beaumont, The Remnants tried inciting rebellion unsuccessfully a couple of time.

Rule of New Calim was secretly transferred from [[Oswald Beaumont]] to [[Dunspero Beaumont]] after The Remnants killed Oswald Beaumont outside of his home The Whispering Tower. [[Gunner Ironford]] sailed to New Calim with an armada of ships and destroyed the city with powerful cannon attacks. The Remnants, the [[Sea of Swords]], and the Clockwork Sentinels fought back and drove Gunner and his fleet away.
