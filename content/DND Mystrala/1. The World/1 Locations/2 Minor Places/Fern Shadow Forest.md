Fern Shadow Forest (forest between [[Karsus Folly]] and [[New Calim]]) - home to a young green dragon and it’s druid servant who cause a blight on the forest and the living beings there. The first encounter the group had with the dragon, [[Allara]], stopped the battle to come to a tenuous truce.

The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] state they tolerate the dragon living in the same forest and have no preference whether it lives or dies. Deciding to finish what they started, the group continues through the forest and hunted the dragon down.

The young green dragon, Rotgasp, had a cabin in the forest and a grouping of followers. During the battle [[Varrick]] viciously attacked the dragon, grappled it, and was flown 190ft in the air before being magically thrown off, killing him. Rotgasp was subsequently killed by the remaining members of the group (Session [[32 - 04282024|32]]).
