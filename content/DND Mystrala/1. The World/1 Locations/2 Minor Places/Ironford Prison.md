## History
[[Gunner Ironford]] was the self-proclaimed ruler.

Prisoners are dropped of by ship on the North End. Overall self regulating since there is no escape. 

## Other General Notes
All prisoners receive an enchanted tattoo that prevents any divination magic from reaching them, unless the caster also has an enchanted tattoo, then they are automatically able to use divination magic against another tattoo wearer. 

Entrance/exit from a cove that is hidden under the throne room, accessible via a [[Clockwork Devices|clockwork elevator]]. Entrance/exit to Ironford Prison from the roof above the island to the left of The Drowned Ward, this leads to an underground passage inside the [[Church of Laduguer]].
