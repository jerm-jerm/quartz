Previously affiliated with [[Restore Family|Undertavern]], he a [[Solonor]]/[[Alexi Faraday|Faraday]] clockwork machine from [[Karsus Folly]] and was supposed to bring it back to the [[Gilded Glave]] but sold it off after having already been paid. Was found spending his new money at The Platinum Grove. The group questioned him, where he revealed the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] was interested in the arcane device and was told it could stabilize a portal to another dimension, Shadowfell, allowing them to better commune with the Raven Queen. This device was to be provided by [[Alexi Faraday]]. He was then approached the night before the job by [[Oswald Beaumont]], at a place called The Wizard's Gauntlet, to get 'robbed' on the road. He was then 'robbed' by The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] . He was paid by both the Undertavern (on accepting the job) and the Duke (for getting 'robbed') for the job. After he gave the group this information he slipped away.
