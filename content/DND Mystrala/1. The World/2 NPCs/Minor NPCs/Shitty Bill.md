Black Tabaxi with greasy yellow eyes. Previously affiliated with [[Restore Family|Undertavern]], he stole a [[Solonor]]/[[Alexi Faraday|Faraday]] clockwork machine from [[Karsus Folly]] and was supposed to bring it back to the [[Gilded Glave]] but sold it off after having already been paid. Was found spending his new money at The Platinum Grove. The group questioned him, where he revealed the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] was interested in the arcane device and was told it could stabilize a portal to another dimension, Shadowfell, allowing them to better commune with the Raven Queen. This device was to be provided by [[Alexi Faraday]]. He was then approached the night before the job by [[Oswald Beaumont]], at a place called The Wizard's Gauntlet, to get 'robbed' on the road. He was then 'robbed' by The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]]. He was paid by both the Undertavern (on accepting the job) and the Duke (for getting 'robbed') for the job. After he gave the group this information he slipped away.

The group met him again after [[Danny]] said he had a contact in Langston. This happened to be Shitty Bill who the group reluctantly met with. He was working with a faction in [[Langston]] and directed them to a number of other factions that might have a problem with [[The Bone King]] or be willing to move against him for the right price.
