## History
Was the boatswain of [[The Icebreaker]] and worked the forge. His only request in the change of power from [[Gunner Ironford]] to The Remnants was to destroy all the Far Empire ships the group came across. States he was previously a prisoner and the sunlight hurts his eyes, which is why he enjoyed working on the ship. Billy was unexpectedly killed by Gunner after [[Sundara]] refused to give Gunner the Shipstarting Scrolls.
