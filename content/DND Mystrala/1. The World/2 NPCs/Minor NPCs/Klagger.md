A gnome that can make [[Psionic Weapons]] by imbuing mundane objects with a psionic signature using a type of clockwork magic. He was initially hired by Faraday (but was never paid) and sent to Valendri. He lived and worked in the Etherium District, he joined with The Remnants after its fall.

He is a fan of butter and rich foods. He is from [[Langston]] and has a lot of knowledge of things with tentacles and slime (leviathans aka krakens?). He is a follower of The [[Raven Queen]].

Seems to have taken a liking to [[Briggs]] and together they are causing mini-chaos on [[The Icebreaker]].
