## History
A member of [[The Savage Seven]] during the destruction of [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]], he used his piece to create a powerful magical hammer that he uses for a weapon (which houses a rounded compressed clockwork device at the head).

Was the ruler of [[Ironford Prison]], during this time he was also a paladin of the [[Church of Laduguer]]. While ruling Ironford Prison he was given instruction by Lord [[Oswald Beaumont]] to murder [[Cassius]] Manath once he arrived. He was also given instruction by [[Solonor]] to monitor [[Sundara]] and keep her from having a cursed tattoo placed on her. The Arch Bishop of the Church moved against Gunner and attacked him at Ironford Prison, this distraction gave The Remnants a chance to escape from prison, stealing the advanced ship, [[The Icebreaker]], that was given to Gunner by Solonor.

Gunner told Cassius that he was no longer a Paladin of the Church of Laduguer. Solonor told Sundara that he broke his oath to the Church.

Apparently attacked and pirated many FETC ships and had a large debt to the FETC.

### Current Activities
Stole back The Icebreaker in New Calim because he had some business out East. The ship was destroyed in the battle (Session [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]). Solonor explained that he repaired the ship for Gunner in exchange for gold, resources, and [[Spark]].

Had [[Chalice Manath]] chained in the captain's quarter of the Icebreaker when Sundara magically looked at the ship.   

Although he broke his oath to the Church he was still Laduguer the goddesses champion. Died at the hands of The Remnants ([[36 - 05272024|Session 36]]), they were not able to trap his soul in the soul cage. Had a Kingslayer Clause in his last will and testament that bequeathed many items to Cassius, who he anticipated may be someone who killed him. Even writing a letter mentioning, "Cassius Manath although it may seem that you had no spine, it seems you do. I am proud."

During the reading of his last will and testament he had kind things to say about almost everyone including some of his enemies.

### Personality Traits
Strongly dislikes charismatic talkative types. Expects for people to listen to him and do as he says without hesitation.

## Associates
Was in a relationship, presumably romantic, with a wizrd/bard who was at his side when the group attacked him In Ironford Prison the second time. Gunner left him a ship in his will.

His mother Freya Yarnsin was present at the reading of his Last Will and Testament, in a letter Gunner asked for forgiveness from her.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Failed to follow instructions from two members of The Savage Seven relating to two members of The Remnants
- Has a strong dislike of Cassius and has threatened the [[Zariah and Anelia Manath|Manath]] family if he keeps causing trouble.
