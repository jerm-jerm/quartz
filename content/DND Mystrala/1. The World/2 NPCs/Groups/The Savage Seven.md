**The Savage Seven - ??? (maybe Solonor, Duke Oswald Beaumout DOB, Lord Faraday, Gunner)**

Savage Seven - Solonor the Disgraced (on his island apart of the Skyshattered Isles), Alexi Faraday (graviturg wizard in his tower in Karsus Folly), Miradark (Death cleric somewhere near the Serpant Lord Shrine), Gunner (the enforcer, half a days travel from us and rapidly approaching), Ironheart (warforged monk wandering the Delmiri desert), and Ottoluke (no longer a part of the SS?, working with the Sea of Swords)

**

Savage Seven - their actions put the world at considerable risk. The devices include Gunner’s hammer, Faraday’s contraption, Miradark’s mace, Ottoluke’s book (which he gambled away fro drinking money)

**Ironheart - “foiled the design of Mechanus”**

Led by Solonor The Disgraced 

**Ottoluke said Ironheart might be agreeable to relinquish his Inevitable Portion**
