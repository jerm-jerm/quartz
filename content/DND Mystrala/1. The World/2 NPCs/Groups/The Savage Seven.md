## History
Brainchild of Solonor, but led by the charismatic Oswald Beaumont. Originally a collection of friends going on random adventures. Somehow the Savage Seven breached the gate of creation thus committing a cosmic crime. Aurunat, [[The Inevitable]], was dispatched to correct this and was destroyed. They took pieces of Aurunat's body as trophies and created powerful magical items. The [[Sea of Swords]] believe the actions of The Savage Seven put the world at considerable risk.
