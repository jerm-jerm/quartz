## History
A nihilist group hoping to return the world to the elemental primordial state to 'restore balance'. Helped with Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]]'s take over of [[New Calim]] and were then rumored to have all been murdered. Members are marked with either twisted vine tattoo that continue into her eyes, nose, and mouth or markings of the work Ruin and Thistle on the back of their hands.

State that all members have been forsaken by the current form of civilization. The have a belief in rebirth through The World Tree and some members have the ability to 'hop between branches.' The group has some connection to The Harbinger, possibly their 'mistress'? and they are also marked by a growing form of lichen somewhere on their person.
