## History
The reason that [[Karsus]] cast the spell Karsus Avatar. Thought to be extinct since [[The Spellplague]].

The Phaerimm Sickness: every 90 days a phaerimm can use it's stinger to place an egg into a humanoid, after a couple of weeks a juvenile will burst out of the wound and remain attached to the host, who will walk around and consume magical items and energy. Can be healed with a greater restoration or remove curse spell.

Juvenile - weak to psionics because they cant tune out the psychic noise around them. 114 teeth.
Knight - less untapped psionic energy but thicker skin (not vulnerable to psionic attacks)
Shepard - 16 arms, grounded
Nobel - larger juveniles, thinner arms, more bulbous bodies; essentially managers of all the lower types; uses magic that borders our own maximum capabilities (9-10th level spells, not bound by the laws of our gods)
Barons - no one has seen or documented what they can do
The Queen - dictates how they all act, all the consciousness of the lower phaerimm are linked to the queen

### Current Activities
Now reappearing in [[Valendri|The Skyshattered Isles]] and feeding off of the arcane engines beneath the island causing The Blight. 

On trying to fly to [[Valendri]], Phaerimm appeared and tried to consume the arcane engine. They have created a system of tunnels beneath Valendri sustaining themselves on the archanotech engines. They have a main hive with a queen deep underground (at the Nexus, where the most powerful arcane batteries that hold up Valendri are), getting too close causes one to fall under her spell.

They have a host of humanoids that they have infected and use to hatch new phaerimm, feeding off of them until they are entirely consumed.

![[Sundaria.png|right|150]] 
The Phaerimm Queen shares a consciousness with Sundaria, [[Sundara|Sundara's]] grandmother who was captured during the first Phaerimm infestation.
