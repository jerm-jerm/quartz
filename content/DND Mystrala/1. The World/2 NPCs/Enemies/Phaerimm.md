## History
The reason that [[Karsus]] cast the spell Karsus Avatar. Thought to be extinct since The Spellplague. 

### Current Activities
Now reappearing in [[Valendri|The Skyshattered Isles]] and feeding off of the arcane engines beneath the island causing The Blight. 

On trying to fly to [[Valendri]], Phaerimm appeared and tried to consume the arcane engine. They have created a system of tunnels beneath Valendri sustaining themselves on the archanotech engines. They have a main hive with a queen deep underground, getting too close causes one to fall under her spell.
