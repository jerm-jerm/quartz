## History
Has previously aligned with the Queen of Brightwater and conducts hostile corporate takeovers. Conducted one on the college that Cassius's family owned. Tarnishing the Manath name in order to take control of the failing college. 

People who work for him have a magical brand that can be seen with a detect magic spell.

[[Cassius]], [[Varrick]], and [[Japheth]] tried to infiltrate The Duke's residence prior to the start of the current Mystrala campaign and were easily captured and sent to [[Ironford Prison]]. There The Duke told [[Gunner Ironford|Gunner]] that Cassius was a particularly troublesome weasel and personally wanted Gunner to ensure that Cassius was killed once he arrived in prison.

### Current Activities
Died after an impromptu battle the The Remnants. His daughter literally took his place, disguising herself to look like him, presumably, to prevent [[Cassius]] for being executed. "Oswald Beaumont" is now sick and his daughter, [[Dunspero Beaumont]], is taking over.
