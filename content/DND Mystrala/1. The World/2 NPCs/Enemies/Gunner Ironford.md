## History
A member of [[The Savage Seven]] during the destruction of [[The Inevitable]], he used his piece to create a powerful magical hammer that he uses for a weapon (which houses a rounded compressed clockwork device at the head).

Was the ruler of [[Ironford Prison]], during this time he was also a paladin of the [[Church of Laduguer]]. While ruling Ironford Prison he was given instruction by Lord [[Oswald Beaumont]] to murder [[Cassius]] Manath once he arrived. He was also given instruction by [[Solonor]] to monitor [[Sundara]] and keep her from having a cursed tattoo placed on her. The Arch Bishop of the Church moved against Gunner and attacked him at Ironford Prison, this distraction gave The Remnants a chance to escape from prison, stealing the advanced ship, [[The Icebreaker]], that was given to Gunner by Solonor.

Gunner told Cassius that he was no longer a Paladin of the Church of Laduguer.

### Current Activities
Stole back The Icebreaker in New Calim because he had some business out East. The ship was destroyed in the battle, so he is presumably working to get it repaired.
