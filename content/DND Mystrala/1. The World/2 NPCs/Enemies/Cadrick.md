Has a wizard tower in [[Karsus Folly]]
**Cadrick - according to him, many people were naysayers and did not believe he would be successful**
**Cadrick - Has a separate, private home from his tower. Was planning (or at least considering) just murdering the group instead of given them the reward for finishing his tower.**
