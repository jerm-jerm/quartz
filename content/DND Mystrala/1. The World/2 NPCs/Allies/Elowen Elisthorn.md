## History
Model citizen and star child of the Elisthorn Family. She was skeptic of [[Sundara]]'s decision to leave Valendri and thought she was putting off her responsibility to their people. Elowen talked among their people that Sundara become Unbound. This severely damaged the sisters relationship before Sundara left.

At one point left Valendri to confront Solonor over what she thought was the death of her sister, she believes him to be a leech on Valendri and that he is somehow responsible for the [[Phaerimm]]. She did not find him in his workshop. Subsequently met Alexi Faraday in what started out as a relationship of convenience.

### Current Activities
Left [[Valendri]] searching for Sundara who was under the [[Ironford Prison]] tattoo curse. She is currently in [[Karsus Folly]] working as a representative for the Valendri people with Prince [[Alexi Faraday]], who she is also romantically involved with. Faraday and Elowen have been working together to create magic outside of the bounds of the current limitations of magic. She admitted to Sundara that she has always been proud of her and sometimes jealous of her magic (Sessions [[29 - 04052024|29]] and [[30 - 04142024|30]]). She has easily taken up the life of someone of the upper class and appears to be very inspired and engrossed in Faraday.

### Personality Traits
Confident and boisterous. Feels she bears the entire burden of the Valendri people on her shoulders.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Older sister to [[Sundara]]
