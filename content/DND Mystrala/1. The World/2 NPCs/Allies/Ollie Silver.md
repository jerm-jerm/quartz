Captain of The Rust Bucket, the flagship ship of the Rust Alley Whalers. He and his crew are originally from [[Orofin]]. Started out as union workers then moved to [[Langston]] to try and make a gang and make some money. They are ambitious and focused. Initially did quiet well, but their business started frying up when the Bone Hunters started taking over their territory in [[The Bone King]]'s name. Initially they blamed The Remnants for the Bone Hunters increased pressure on them, their opinions changed after the group help them capture a massive Kraken and fended off Bone Hunter crews that tried to poach the carcass.

Ollie Silver and The Rust Alley Whalers when they collect krakens usually sell parts of it to a sea witch that comes from the bottom of the sea, takes her haul and walks back into the water. All they know is that she uses the bones for 'witchcraft.' The rest of the parts are sent to [[Bloodgulch Meatworks]] on rails that run via primitive arcanotech.
