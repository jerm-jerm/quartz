## History
Previously worked as a Paladin in the Order of Vigilance. They lived in a village to the West when the [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] opened a portal to the elemental plane of water which destroyed their home, which is now at the bottom of a lake.

### Current Activities
Sundara first encounters her investigating the remains of The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] battle ([[13 - 12162023|Session 13]]), she gives Sundara her business card but doesn't meet the rest of the group. They meet with her again a few days later, including Varrick, and it is revealed that they were previously married and have kids together ([[15 - 01012024|Session 15]]).

She later notes that the Order of Vigilance and [[Sea of Swords]] have merged into one entity and offers the group a position in the Sea of Swords ([[23 - 02232024|Session 23]]).

Unbeknownst to her she has lost all memory of being married to Varrick or him being the father of their children ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). Possibly in a relationship with Garrick, also of the Sea of Swords.

### Personality Traits
Imposing, blunt, and straight to the point. Can be fiery with her responses, both verbal and physical.
