## History
Previously worked as a Paladin in the Order of Vigilance. She and the rest of the order lived in a village in the West when the [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] opened a portal to the elemental plane of water which destroyed their home and is now at the bottom of a lake.

Sundara first encounters her investigating the remains of The Circle of Ruin and Thistle battle ([[13 - 12162023|Session 13]]), she gives Sundara her business card but doesn't meet the rest of the group. They meet with her again a few days later, including Varrick, and it is revealed that they were previously married and have kids together ([[15 - 01012024|Session 15]]).

She later notes that the Order of Vigilance and [[Sea of Swords]] have merged into one entity and offers the group a position in the Sea of Swords ([[23 - 02232024|Session 23]]).

Unbeknownst to her she lost all memory of being married to Varrick or him being the father of their children ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). Possibly in a relationship with Garrick, also of the Sea of Swords.

Varrick told her about his pact and her missing memories. Realizing her memories were ripped from her and going through the loss all over again she becomes furious with Varrick and punches him in the face. She later hugs and kisses him when he safely returns Natasha who stowed away on [[The Icebreaker]]. She tells him that she plans on finding the witch that made that pact with him and dissolving her and their entire circle ([[38 - 06082024|Session 38]]). 

After dinner at Barrowmoor Manor, she tells Varrick that if he came home and became a father it would make things easier for her. Varrick later tells her that he has more to do to make sure the world is safe for Natasha before settling down.

### Current Activities
Appears to be disgruntled and stressed out with how [[Dunspero Beaumont]] is running [[New Calim]], saying that Dunspero is running the city into the ground.

### Personality Traits
Imposing, blunt, and straight to the point. Can be fiery with her responses, both verbal and physical.
