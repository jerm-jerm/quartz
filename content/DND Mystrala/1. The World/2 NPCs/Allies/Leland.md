Leland (whose surname was taken by the sea before he became a man) is a super old man that climbed up from the bottom of [[The Icebreaker]] when the group first took it over. He is a mysterious man, refusing to step foot on land, and is on a nocturnal schedule. Call all the members of The Remnants, "Capitan."
It is discovered in the battle between [[Gunner Ironford|Gunner's]] armada against the city of [[New Calim]] that he is a warlock who made a pact that he cannot step on land, if he does his soul will likely be taken. If the group ever needs a first mate for a ship, he tells them to give him a call. He is currently in possession of one sending stone and the group is holding the other one.

Once back in New Calim with The Icebreaker in tow, he returned to The Remnants with a couple other crew members and resumed his position as first mate.
