Leland (whose surname was taken by the sea before he became a man) is a super old man that climbed up from the bottom of [[The Icebreaker]] when the group first took it over. He is a mysterious man, refusing to step foot on land, and is on a nocturnal schedule. Call the members of The Remnants, "Capitan."
It's discovered in the battle against [[Gunner Ironford|Gunner's]] armada against the city of [[New Calim]] that he is a warlock that made a pact that he cannot step on land, if he does his soul will likely be taken. If the group ever needs a first mate for a ship, give him a call.
