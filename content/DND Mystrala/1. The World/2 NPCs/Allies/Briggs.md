Used to be the base player of the group, stabbed Varrick at one point. Likes explosives.

In the attack on [[New Calim]] by [[Gunner Ironford]], he blew up the engine of [[The Icebreaker]] to scuttle the ship. 

Returned to the group when [[Leland]] resumed his position as first mate.

Seems to have taken a liking to [[Klagger]] and together they are causing mini-chaos on [[The Icebreaker]], apparently creating IEDs.
