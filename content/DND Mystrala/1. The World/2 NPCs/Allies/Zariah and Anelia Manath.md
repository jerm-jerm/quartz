Zariah and Anelia Manuth are the parents to [[Cassius]] and their adopted daughter, [[Chalice Manath]].  They are performers and happy to be on the road and spend time together. They visit Cas in [[New Calim]] and tell him that they came to the city out of concern for him, not for Cas to be worried about his parents. His mom looks unimpressed and almost disappointed when Cas casually mentions that he killed DOB ([[23 - 02232024|Session 23]]). Cassius and Anelia share a pair of sending stones.  

The family is reunited after the group frees Chalice from prison ([[37 - 06012024|Session 37]]). They celebrate and during the festivities check in on Cassius' companions, eventually giving them a seal of approval. They plan on returning to [[Brightwater]] to give music lessons and maybe restart a college.
