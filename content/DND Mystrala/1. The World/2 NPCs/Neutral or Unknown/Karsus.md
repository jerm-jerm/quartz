In the Age of Arcanum, Karsus crafted a ritual, known as Karsus' Avatar, to allow him to assume the mantle of a god. He did this during the [[The Spellplague]] while [[Phaerimm]] were wreaking havoc. He killed thousands in the process of creating this avatar, and chose to become the god of magic, Mystra. In doing so broke her concentration on the weave. This destroyed all magic and Mystra herself. In that moment a new god/goddess of magic was born (and placed the limitation we now know on magic) and Karsus died, falling into the sea. The floating cities, all but [[Valendri]], fell as well, killing thousands. His body makes up the land, but is suspected to not be inert. It is believed that the heart of Karsus could be used to create another avatar. Many wizards believed that his ritual could have been successful if he chosen another god's mantle to assume.
