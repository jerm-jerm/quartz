Valender, the godfather of Valendri, a half-elf half-human who united multiple elf societies to rival Nethero. Valender collected forgotten lore and sought knowledge from the outer planes. He tried to create a plan of pure order and harmony. In doing so contactedÂ [[Mechanus]]. Certain offspring are blessed with some of the same power. After having a daughter, [[Solara and Cyndir Elisthorn|Solara]], he eventually left to stop the [[Phaerimm]]. He took up the name Karsus.

In the Age of Arcanum, Karsus crafted a ritual, known as Karsus' Avatar, to allow him to assume the mantle of a god. He did this during the [[The Spellplague]] while Phaerimm were wreaking havoc. He killed thousands in the process of creating this avatar, and chose to become the god of magic, Mystra. In doing so broke her concentration on the weave. This destroyed all magic and Mystra herself. In that moment a new god/goddess of magic was born (and placed the limitation we now know on magic) and Karsus died, falling into the sea. The floating cities, all but [[Valendri]], fell as well, killing thousands. His body makes up the land, but is suspected to not be inert. It is believed that the heart of Karsus could be used to create another avatar. Many wizards believed that his ritual could have been successful if he chosen another god's mantle to assume, but it is now known that he intentionally chose Mystra to starve the Phaerimm of the weave.

He would not have subscribed to the way Valendri is an isolationist nation and wanted to unite people. Was close friends with [[Solonor]] before his demise.
