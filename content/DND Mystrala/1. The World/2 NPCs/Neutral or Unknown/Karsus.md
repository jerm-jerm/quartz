- In the Age of Arcanum mortals were at war with the gods (Netherio vs the Gods) and had access to high level magic (would be considered 12th level spells today). Karsus crafted a ritual to allow him to assume the mantle of a god. He killed thousands in the process of creating this avatar, becoming the god of magic, Mystra, for a brief moment, but in doing so broke her concentration the weave. This destroyed all magic and Mystra herself. In that moment a new goddess of magic was born and Karsus died, falling into the sea. The floating cities fell as well, killing thousands. His body makes up the land, but is suspected to not be inert. Suspected that the heart of Karsus could be used to create another avatar. A new god/goddess of magic was born and stabilized the weave and put limitations on magic.
