Listened to [[Allara]] after [[Varrick]]'s death and deemed his resurrection necessary. Has her own agenda on who lives and dies and she expects her followers, The [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] to follow this agenda. 

[[Dagon]] himself, or a representative, states that The Raven Queen only showed Varrick what he wanted to see and that his son was not truly alive or chosen by her. The Queen was originally a mortal Netherese wizard who took up the visage of the God of Death, but no one would follow her so she chose her new domain of Fate. [[The Traveler]] and her know each other in some capacity.
