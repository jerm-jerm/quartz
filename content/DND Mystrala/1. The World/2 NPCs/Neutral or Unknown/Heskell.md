## History
Works with The Wayward Witches who help give jobs to those in need

### Current Activities
Presumably has some beef with [[The Bone King|Elhorn]] but can't actively go after him thus is helping The Remnants

### Personality Traits
Obviously rich but helpful and doesn't seem to subscribe explicitly to class divides, is willing to help a server with plating the table
Eerily positive but occasionally says or does something that implies a questionable darkness underneath all of that

### Relation to The Remnants 
Met the group after being introduced by [[Dunspero Beaumont]] and offering an exchange of services

## Known Stats
Detect magic - he gives off some magical reverberation that is separate from his magical trinkets
