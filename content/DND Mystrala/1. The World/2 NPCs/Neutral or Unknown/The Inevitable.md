Aurunat was an Inevitable created by [[Mechanus]], a god responsible for balance, law, and order. Role is to correct a cosmic imbalance. Aurunat was slain by [[The Savage Seven]] and pieces of it's body were used to create powerful magical items. The [[Sea of Swords]] believes that by reuniting the items they can prevent the destruction of Karsus/Mystrala again if someone were to recreate [[Karsus]]'s Avatar ritual.
