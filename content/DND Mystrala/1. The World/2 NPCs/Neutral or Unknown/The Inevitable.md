Aurunat was an Inevitable created by [[Mechanus]], a god responsible for balance, law, and order. Their role is to correct particular cosmic imbalances. Aurunat was slain by [[The Savage Seven]] and pieces of[[Pieces of The Inevitable| it's body]] were used to create powerful magical items. The [[Sea of Swords]] believes that by reuniting the items they can prevent the destruction of Karsus/Mystrala again if someone were to recreate the [[Karsus]]'s Avatar ritual.
