## History
A sorcerer of legends, some say he is a lich, others that he has been alive since the survival of the fall of Nethero. Solonor says that he is of [[Mechanus]] and therefore immortal, lived at least over 1,000 years ago. He has an obsession with the plane of Mechanus and the hierarchy of the automatons there. Imagines replicating their perfect society. Long ago he tried to save Valendri, but they chose [[Karsus]] instead. He has lived for millennia, has seen the weave itself. Time does not pass for him like it does for others. He is well versed in Netherese magic and the monstrosities of Karsus. 

Is known through Karsus as The Shipbuilder, a creator of various magical [[Clockwork Devices]], such as the elevator in [[Ironford Prison]], [[The Icebreaker]], and the Clockwork Sentinels in [[New Calim]] and [[Langston]].

Is aware that Faraday is hunting him for his piece of [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]]. Has purchased supplies from [[Gunner Ironford]] including [[Spark]], but sees him as a brute. Otherwise unknown current activities.

Bequeathed a large deposit of dark iron by Gunner on his death, was not present at The Last Will and Testament, instead The Engineer went in his place.

### Current Activities
Sundara and Solonor finally reconcile ([[53 - 09302024|Session 53]]) over dinner at Barrowmoor Manor. During dinner he mentions turning away from using spark for the sentinels and moving on to other projects. He says he is waiting for her to leave her current adventures behind and embrace her destiny at his side, thinks it would take a few hundred years of planning, research, and acquiring. At the end of the night, invited her to his home in Burning Hands and gives her a key to his workshop.
