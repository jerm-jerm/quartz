## History
His ancestors from Drakemire fought alongside the Netherese against the [[Phaerimm]].

A part of [[The Savage Seven]] when they destroyed [[The Inevitable]] and made magic items from its corpse. Has a wizard tower in [[Karsus Folly]]. Previously had a scribe, [[Kazak]] Ninefingers, that worked for him. He imprisoned this scribe after he studied some of Faraday's secret scrolls. In his tower he has the gavel of [[The Inevitable]] on display in one of the many halls.

Created a device, supposedly, for the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] to open a portal to Shadowfell to have a closer connection to the Raven Queen.

### Current Activities
Working in some capacity with [[Solonor]] to create magic devices that have a component of both clockwork and magical runes.

Believes magic should be freely given, that limitations are a bastardization of magic, and it should be like it was before the Spellplague.

### Personality Traits
Comes off as charismatic and charming, tries to defuse tense situations with jokes and really nice alcohol.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Is in a romantic relationship with [[Sundara|Sundara Elisthorn's]] sister [[Elowen Elisthorn]]
