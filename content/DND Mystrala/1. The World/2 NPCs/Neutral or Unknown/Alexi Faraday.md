## History
His ancestors from Drakemire fought alongside the Netherese against the [[Phaerimm]].

A part of [[The Savage Seven]] when they destroyed [[The Inevitable]] and made magic items from its corpse. Has a wizard tower in [[Karsus Folly]]. Previously had a scribe, [[Kazak]] Ninefingers, that worked for him. He imprisoned this scribe after he studied some of Faraday's secret scrolls. In his tower he has the gavel of [[The Inevitable]] on display in one of the many halls.

Created a device, supposedly, for the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] to open a portal to Shadowfell to have a closer connection to the Raven Queen.

### Current Activities
Working in some capacity with [[Solonor]] to create magic devices that have a component of both clockwork and magical runes.

Believes magic should be freely given, that limitations are a bastardization of magic, and it should be like it was before the Spellplague. At his charity ball event cast a High Magic spell, "All Mage" giving him the knowledge of lifetimes of magic in one moment. He then met with the group and told them he wished to give this power to all people. He has collected most of the [[Pieces of The Inevitable]] and requested the Harmonic Resonator so that he could confront Solonor and recreate [[The Inevitable]] ([[30 - 04142024|Session 30]]).

### Personality Traits
Comes off as charismatic and charming, tries to defuse tense situations with jokes and really nice alcohol. Hints of ungovernable ambition in his eyes when he talks about his goals.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Is in a romantic relationship with [[Elowen Elisthorn]]
