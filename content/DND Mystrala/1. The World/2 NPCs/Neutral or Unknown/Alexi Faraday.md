## History
His ancestors from Drakemire fought alongside the Netherese against the [[Phaerimm]]. Faraday commissioned a ship to escape and when the captain of that ship found a secret of his, he allegedly had the entire crew killed. This led to [[Vitaly]] Draganovic on a quest of revenge.

A part of [[The Savage Seven]] when they destroyed [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]] and made magic items from its corpse. Has a wizard tower in [[Karsus Folly]]. Previously had a scribe, [[Kazak]] Ninefingers, that worked for him. He imprisoned this scribe after he studied some of Faraday's secret scrolls. In his tower he has the gavel of [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]] on display in one of the many halls.

Created a device, supposedly, for the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] to open a portal to Shadowfell to have a closer connection to the Raven Queen.

Faraday states he was once wronged by a man with power and understands how it feels. He has deviated from his moral code in the past, doing things that have kept him up at night.

Was? working in some capacity with [[Solonor]] to create magic devices that have a component of both clockwork and magical runes.

### Current Activities
Believes magic should be freely given, that limitations are a bastardization of magic, and it should be like it was before [[The Spellplague]]. At his charity ball event cast a High Magic spell, "All Mage" giving him the knowledge of lifetimes of magic in one moment. He then met with the group and told them he wished to give this power to all people. He has collected most of the [[Pieces of The Inevitable]] and requested the Harmonic Resonator so that he could confront Solonor and recreate [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]] ([[30 - 04142024|Session 30]]).

Solonor thinks that Faraday is rebuilding The Inevitable. When discussing with the group, they considered that he is trying to use The Inevitable's identity to access something only it is able to, such as the heart of [[Karsus]]. Later, in his will, [[Gunner Ironford]] confirms that Faraday is on a journey to awake the heart of Karsus.

Has been supplying [[psionic weapons]] to the [[Valendri]] people to aid in their battle against The [[Phaerimm]]. 

Is trying to purchase The Legend of the Moonwarden from [[The Bone King]].

At dinner at Barrowmoor Manor, Solonor confirms that [[Spark|tincture]] was an invention of Faraday's.

### Personality Traits
Comes off as charismatic and charming, tries to defuse tense situations with jokes and really nice alcohol. Hints of ungovernable ambition in his eyes when he talks about his goals. Made a fair trade with The Remnants when he clearly had the upper hand.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Is in a romantic relationship with [[Elowen Elisthorn]]
- [[Vitaly]] is determined to prevent Faraday from obtaining the pieces of The Inevitable
