## History
Adopted by Oswald Beaumont. 

Met [[Cassius]] Manath at some point and became 'entangled' in a relationship.

### Current Activities
Has been pretending to be her dead father [[Oswald Beaumont]], after watching his untimely death at the hands of The Remnants. She created legally binding documents so that she would become the sole inheritor of the Beaumont estate.  Feigned that Oswald Beaumont was severely ill and died and that she is took over for him in a gradual and legal process.

Seen talking with [[Serpa]] at [[Alexi Faraday]]'s charity ball. Has markings of a member of The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] on her hands (only witnessed by [[Allara]]). Reconciled with Cassius, admitted to her dislike of her father, and asked Cas to come back to [[New Calim]] with her. Said that he would always have a spot there if he chose to ([[30 - 04142024|Session 30]]). The members of the [[Sea of Swords]] said that the city is in the process of giving her unilateral power to make decisions ([[34 - 05122024|Session 34]]).

On rescuing [[Chalice Manath]], she told the group that she had been a prisoner of the Beaumont's for months, first Oswald and then Dunspero, before being handed over to Gunner.

### Personality Traits
Level-headed even when angry.

### Relation to The Remnants 
- Romantically tied to [[Cassius]] Manath 
- [[Varrick]] killed her father

## Known Stats
Can cast illusion spells. Possibly a warlock.
