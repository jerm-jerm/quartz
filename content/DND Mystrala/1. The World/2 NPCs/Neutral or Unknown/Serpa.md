## History

### Current Activities
Male goliath druid that is a part of The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]]. Was brought back from the dead by Melania. Battled with Varrick in a duel during Alexi Faraday's party. Looks similar to [[Varrick]].

Notes that all members of The Circle were once forsaken by the current civilization. Since he was a child he was under contract by the FETC and forced to do hard labor. He believes that everyone is either the boot or has one pressed to their neck. Has fungal moss-like lichen growing out of where his heart is. It is an identical pattern and species that is on Varrick's hammer.

### Personality Traits
