![[The Icebreaker.png]]

## Overview
Arcane ship created by [[Solonor]], The Shipmaker. Combination of mechanical clockwork and arcane sigils that allows the ship to move faster than most despite it's heavy plating. The engine is comprised of a glass globe on the deck. A wizard utilizing either Shipstarting Scrolls or who learns to control the ship can direct it magically. 

The group placed an enchanting lectern from the Delmiri Desert in the lower levels of the ship.

[[Sundara]] utilized the Shipstarting scrolls to learn how to operate The Icebreaker when [[Kazak]] left the group.

The ship was destroyed by [[Briggs]], when the group was confronted by [[Gunner Ironford]] in the bay of [[New Calim]] and [[Sundara]] refused to give [[Gunner Ironford]] the remaining Shipstarting Scrolls, instead burning them in front of him. He attacked the group and [[Briggs]] blew up the ship engine during the escape. 

### Location

### Capabilities
