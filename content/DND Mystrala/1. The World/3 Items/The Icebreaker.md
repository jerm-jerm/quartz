## Overview
Arcane ship created by [[Solonor]], The Shipmaker. Combination of mechanical clockwork and arcane sigils that allows the ship to move faster than most despite it's heavy plating. The engine is comprised of a glass globe on the deck. A wizard utilizing either Shipstarting Scrolls or a magic user who learns can control the ship and direct it magically. 

The group placed an enchanting lectern from the Delmiri Desert in the lower levels of the ship.

[[Sundara]] utilized the Shipstarting scrolls and her Clockwork Magic to learn how to operate The Icebreaker when [[Kazak]] left the group.

The group was confronted by Gunner in the bay of [[New Calim]] and Sundara refused to give Gunner the remaining Shipstarting Scrolls, instead burning them in front of his face. He attacked the group and Briggs blew up the ship engine during the escape (Session [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]). 

Repaired by Solonor and is back in order, initially the group saw [[Gunner Ironford]] on it with a captive [[Chalice Manath]], in Igenstad. 

The group stole the ship back after killing Gunner ([[36 - 05272024|Session 36]]). Gunner had a Kingslayer Clause in his will that bequeathed the ship's deed to his murderers. 

[[Samugi]] and Sundara created a relay to attach the [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinel]] to the ship. The engine room transformed from a blue light to a warm golden glow. The soul living in the sentinel, Beverly Waverly, regained her sentience and is able to control the ships functions including steering, weapons, and flying. She particularly enjoys flying ([[37 - 06012024|Session 37]]).
