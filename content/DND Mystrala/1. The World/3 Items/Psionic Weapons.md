Convert spell energy into a blade. Effective against [[Phaerimm]]. Created by [[Alexi Faraday]] and sent to [[Valendri]].

Specifically a magic user can imbue the weapon with their spell energy which charges the weapon and allows the user to utilize some of its psionic effects. They hit using their spellcasting attack bonus. If a users spellcasting modifier is above 4 they get two attacks per turn.

These weapons can be made by [[Klagger]], a gnome that Faraday hired (but didn't pay) and sent to Valendri. He lived and worked in the Etherium District, and then he joined with The Remnants after its fall.
