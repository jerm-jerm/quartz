Called Tincture in it's undistilled form, it is turned into Spark by an Alchemist. It originates from souls, whether dead mercenaries, some who die naturally, and other unknown sources. It can be used to power certain [[Clockwork Devices]], it can also be distilled into a drink that leaves the consumer with particular feelings depending on the brew or into eyedrops which allows a glimpse into ?the spirit world. Much, if not all, of the tincture originates from The [[Bloodgulch Meatworks]] in [[Langston]]. There was a transportation set up under the guise of the FETC from Langston to [[Karsus Folly]] where, the Spark was sold in a tavern, The Taphouse, by Corbin Blackwater 'Corbie' ([[26 - 03172024|Session 26]]).

There is evidence that the souls used to make Spark are retained in a fractured form even once placed inside of clockwork device.

About 60% of tincture is produced at Bloodgulch Meatworks and another 15% at The Vulture Den, from people who volunteer for a some exchange of gold or food or unwilling souls.
