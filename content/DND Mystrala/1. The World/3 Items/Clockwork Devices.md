The more complex "living" clockwork devices require [[Spark]] to function. Multiple iterations of these, some more rudimentary than others. Many connect to a 'collective.' First seen in a widespread force invading [[New Calim]] with [[Oswald Beaumont]] ([[16 - 01092024|Session 16]]). These were originally created by [[Solonor]], who viewed their creation as a type of art. They are assembled in a factory primarily run by gnomes from the Engineering Consortium, an 'engineer' (possibly a [[Valendri|Valendrian elf]]) is responsible to putting the [[Spark|tincture]] in them as part of the final step of assembly ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]). With enough effort [[Sundara]] can destroy them magically or disconnect them from the collective and have them follow her commands. [[Samugi]] has spent time learning how these devices work. He has a higher chance of disabling devices created by Solonor and is able to use his tinkering skills to make his own. 

There is evidence that the souls used to make Spark are retained even once placed inside of clockwork device.

Other clockwork devices include those made by Samugi's tinkering or Sundara's clockwork magic or a combination. They have also purchased clockwork devices such as Allara's prosthetic leg.

[[The Icebreaker]] is an immensely complex clockwork device, made up of a clockwork/arcane engine that powers a lightweight but armored ship.

### Location
Large collection of sentinels located in [[New Calim]].

### Capabilities
More advanced Clockwork Sentinels speak with a mechanical version of Solonor’s voice. 
- “The machine has detected something”
- “The machine has deemed you are not a threat”
- “The machine has been disconnected from the collective”
- “The machine is trying to reset”
- “Requesting an engineer”
