## Overview
- Rudimentary Clockwork Soldiers
- Clockwork Sentinels 
- Clockwork Trolls

Some require [[Spark]] to function. Multiple iterations of them, some more rudimentary than others. Many connect to a 'collective.' 

With enough effort [[Sundara]] can destroy them magically or disconnect them from the collective and have them follow her commands.

### Location
Large collection located in [[New Calim]].

### Capabilities
More advanced Clockwork Sentinels speak with a mechanical version of Solonor’s voice. 
- “The machine has detected something”
- “The machine has deemed you are not a threat”
- “The machine has been disconnected from the collective”
- “The machine is trying to reset”
- “Requesting an engineer”
