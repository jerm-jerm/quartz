## Overview
- Rudimentary Clockwork Soldiers
- Clockwork Sentinels 
- Clockwork Trolls

Some require [[Spark]] to function. Multiple iterations of them, some more rudimentary than others. Many connect to a 'collective.' First seen in a widespread force invading [[New Calim]] with [[Oswald Beaumont]] ([[16 - 01092024|Session 16]]). These were originally created in some part by [[Solonor]], who viewed them as a type of art. They are assembled in a factory primarily run by gnomes from the Engineering Consortium, an 'engineer' is responsible to putting the [[Spark|tincture]]  in them as part of the final step of assembly ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

With enough effort [[Sundara]] can destroy them magically or disconnect them from the collective and have them follow her commands.

[[Samugi]] has spent time learning how these devices work. He has a higher chance of disabling devices created by Solonor and is able to use his tinkering skills to make his own. 

### Location
Large collection located in [[New Calim]].

### Capabilities
More advanced Clockwork Sentinels speak with a mechanical version of Solonor’s voice. 
- “The machine has detected something”
- “The machine has deemed you are not a threat”
- “The machine has been disconnected from the collective”
- “The machine is trying to reset”
- “Requesting an engineer”
