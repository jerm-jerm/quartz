Scourge Angels were a breed of angels created to destroy other gods, wipe out their followers, and turn their planes of existence to glass. The lore is that those deities were eventually killed (either by their own or other deity angels). But the Scourge Angels have no purpose, no order, and only exist to destroy worlds.
