A separate plane, a Jazirian creation, where ?Primus rules and law and order are the driving force. The world consist of massive interlocking gears that float in space. There exist a hierarchy of automatons in what [[Solonor]] has described as the perfect society. The only time Mechanus interacts with the outer planes is through [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]] which correct cosmic imbalances.

At some point there was a war in Mechanus after a demon prince, Orcus, corrupted a Secondus and split the loyalty of the beings in Mechanus in half: those that believed he was the true Primus and those that worshipped the original Primus. 

There is also a theory that magic beyond the bounds placed after the fall of Karsus is being rendered in Mechanus.
