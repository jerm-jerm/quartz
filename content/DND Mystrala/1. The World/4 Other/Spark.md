Tincture in it's undistilled form, turned into Spark by an Alchemist. They originate from souls, wither dead mercenaries, some who die naturally, and other unknown sources. Used to power certain [[Clockwork Devices]] also can be distilled into a drink that leaves the drinker with particular feelings depending on the brew or into eyedrops. Much, if not all, of the tincture originates from The [[Bloodgulch Meatworks]] in [[Langston]].
