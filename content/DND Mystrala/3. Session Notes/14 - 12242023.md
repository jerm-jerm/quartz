## Events
The group infiltrated The Platinum Grove, there [[Serpa]] turned a large muscular dead body into water in a patch of grass outside the casino, witnessed by Allara. Afterwards, Cassius disguised as a rich guest, offended another guest, he offered a one vs one battle of honor. Varrick fought a member of the [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] and won. The group (some invisible) confronted [[Shitty Bill]], dragging him from the 6th floor of the Platinum Grove to a tavern to interrogate him.

He said the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]] was interested in the arcane device and was told it could stabilize a portal to another dimension, Shadowfell, allowing them to better commune with the Raven Queen. This device was to be provided by Lord [[Alexi Faraday]]. Shitty Bill was then approached the night before the job by Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]], at a place called The Wizard's Gauntlet, to get 'robbed' on the road. He was then 'robbed' by The Circle of Ruin and Thistle. He was paid by both the [[Restore Family | Undertavern]] (on accepting the job) and the Duke (for getting 'robbed') for the job.
