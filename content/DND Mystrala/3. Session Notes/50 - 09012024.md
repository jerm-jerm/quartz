## Events
The group spend some downtime at The Harbor Ghost hideout. Cas spars with Danny and explains that he doesn't even like the nickname Dannyboy. Samugi does some tinkering and learns about the kraken pheromones in their possession.

Abrams gathers the crew and in a muted anger reminds them not to bring any heat back to the hideout. They consult with him about their next move, deciding to hit [[The Bone King|Elhorn's]] leviathan hunting operation instead of [[Bloodgulch Meatworks]] given the heat on them. They learn that the Bone Hunters have neutralized all of their competition except The Rust Alley Whalers and they have even taken to attacking them in [[Langston]] waters to steal their Kraken carcasses which was previously unheard of. 

They learn that Elhorn's operation is approximately 36 ships, 8 in the yard undergoing repairs, and 5-12 out on each Kraken run. The ships themselves are coated with thick iron plating, arcane countermeasures, and enchantments.

The group meets up with Ollie Silver of the Rust Alley Whalers. Varrick goes to talk to him alone with Cassius entertains his crew. Varrick comes out of the meeting and its determined that the group is going to go out on a Kraken hunting run with them to prove their worth. They also pay them with a generous 1000g for the job. They give the group some bits of advice (don't get grabbed, go limp if you do, listen to the divemaster, and the faster you move the less likely you are to get hit by lightning) and they are thrust into battle.

After an intense battle, the loss of multiple crew members, and judicious use of magic, Varrick makes the killing blow on the Kraken. As he does, he cries out in pain and collapses as the plain spear he thrust into the Kraken's eye is transformed into a magical trident. He has visions of the Kraken itself destroying ships, collecting bones, creating an alter, and worshipping 'That Which Lies Beneath.'
