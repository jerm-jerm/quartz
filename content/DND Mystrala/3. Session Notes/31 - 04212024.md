## Events
The group started off with a shopping trip to Artist's magical store about 50 feet in the sky. Each member (except Varrick who found the shopkeeper creepy) bought a magic item. Allara bought a magic broom, Cass bought armor, Samugi bought bracers that improve his defense, and Sundara bought an item that allows for sending and scrying. 

Cassius and Varrick heatedly discussed Varrick's new association with The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]]. Varrick states he took the power specifically to protect [[Sarah Stoneheart|Sarah]] and their daughter Natasha. Because they may make powerful enemies it may be best they are not associated so that those people cannot target them now.

Allara meets alone with her brother. He is visiting from Orofin and is no longer going to be working with Fitzroy anymore. His contract, which is owned by The Far Empire, was sold to Xander. There is an encampment near the Serpent Lord Shrine and they are going to be conducting a more occult investigation. His contact [[The Savage Seven|Mira(?)]] knows about Allara and wants to know if she would be amenable to working with her. They are working on 'end of the world stuff' out at the Serpent Lord Shrine.

Samugi has a conversation with a Hangul Dynasty gnome. He states he is an emissary of one of the [[Karsus Folly]] universities and ambassador to the magically gifted. He gives Samugi a cup of tea. The cup is fine china and has a depiction of the Legend of the [[Oni|Dokkaebi]] on it. Samugi mentions that he has previously encountered a [[Oni|Dokkaebi]] ([[06 - 10292023|Session 6-9]]), to which the man says that is a powerful enemy. Samugi sips the scalding hot tea. The man briefly mentions the right path of destiny and then abruptly departs, leaving his tea set behind.

Cassius notes he meant to check on his sister, Chalice, earlier but forgot. They try sending a message and scrying on, but both attempts fail. They wonder if she was sent to [[Ironford Prison]], but they also consider the worst and that she might be dead. 

In the forest between Karsus Folly and [[New Calim]] on their way to kill the dragon, the group formally meets Verdana and are taken to the Circle's camp. She is the druid they previously encountered in Session [[11 - 12032023|Session 11]], she notes that Varrick was initiated after he was reborn through the world tree after he died battling Serpa, who they meet with again inside of the camp. Allara tries to convince the young green dragon to come lay waste to the camp, but the dragon tells Allara to kill them all herself. The camp is filled with men, women, and children all with similar tattoos living in harmony with nature. Serpa tells the group after Allara ask that their goal is to restore balance, to destroy the snakes of the world that create things like indentured servitude and take souls to use as tincture. Fungus lichen grows from Serpa's chest and on Varrick's sword.
