## Events
Anyone who purchases guns from [[Reginald Donovan|Reggie]] goes missing, which has been bad for his business. After the group purchases a gun they go hang out in a tavern. Cassius while using detect magic to study why [[Varrick]] was acting weird detects someone with [[Oswald Beaumont| The Duke's]] brand watching them. They have tattoos similar to the druid woman in the mountains, which they have learned marks them as part of The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]]. After a chase through the streets of the city, the group confronted them. A close battle ensues, a couple of enemies escape and a few are killed but the group collects a bag of holding with weapons from The Huntsman's Promise inside, indicating this group was behind the missing customers. 

Varrick's curse, placed on him by [[Serpa |the druid in the mountains]] is removed by Allara. Cassius also detects the the tattoos we have marking us from [[Ironford Prison]] are some sort of enchantment, but he doesn't tell the group this.
