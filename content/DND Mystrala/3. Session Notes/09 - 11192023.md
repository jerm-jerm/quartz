## Events
Attacked by more Langston Pirates, even using [[The Icebreaker]] as a weapon to destroy one of their ships, until a ship working for the [[Sea of Swords]] Paladin Order arrived and help us finish the pirates. Capitan [[Reyna]] and an old wizard [[Ottoluke Organdorf]] Organdorf offered to travel back to [[New Calim]] with us. That night we all smoked gnome clover and exchanged secrets.

> [!warning]+ Warning  
> Ottoluke and Capitan Kalimoff are in possession of a key that might end the world, the other key is held by a companion of theirs. 

[[Thaunia|Thaunia]] continued to act abnormally. She pulled out one of her hooked fanged teeth. We confronted her and confirmed that the [[Oni]] was inside of her. Varrick and Allara took Thaunia down and locked her in the Brig inside the ship.
