## Events
[[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinels]] created by [[Solonor]] flood into the city, led by Lord [[Oswald Beaumont]], he is riding on a wooden construct of a horse, being very charming, warm, and comforting. He says he is creating order and that they people of [[New Calim]] will never have to deal with something like this again (referencing the destruction of the city by fire elementals from last session). The [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinels]] attack anything they deem a threat but otherwise are not hurting citizens.

The group leaves the main city and heads to [[The Icebreaker]]. Using the Shipstarting Scrolls, blueprints, and her ability to commune with [[Clockwork Devices]], Sundara learns to control the ship. The group spends the night on the ship off the dock. Overnight, [[Cassius]], calls out to the Traveler for help and has a conversation with the patron that made him a Changeling.

In the morning, the group reenters the city, some semblance of order has returned. [[Thomas Malone|Thomas]] declares that the [[Gilded Glave]] is no more.
