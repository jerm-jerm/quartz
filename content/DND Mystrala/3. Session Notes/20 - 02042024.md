## Events
The group ran from the scene where [[Sundara]] overtook a [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinel]]. They hid inside of the house of a member of [[The Merchant Consortium]] while sentinels searched the city. Gideon Mallory entered the house stating that he was no friend of [[Oswald Beaumont]] and wants to know how Sundara is connected to the sentinels. Gideon was investigating a missing woman, Elanor Waverly, she initially seemed dead by Divination magic. She then repaired in the city, but inside of the sentinel that we captured. This was confirmed by using his 'Identify' monocle. The suspicion is somehow souls are being captured or stolen by Necromancy magic and are used in the creation of the liquid that powers the [[Clockwork Devices|Sentinels]]. 

[[Sundara]] and [[Allara]] decided to scout the Whispering Tower for the ledger that the [[Restore Family]] hired them to get. They made it through the magical dispel ward on the backdoor. After making it past the cook, [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Sentinels]], and sneaking into some rooms They alerted [[Oswald Beaumont]] to their presence who promptly attacked the intruders. [[Allara]] was downed, and [[Sundara]] counterspelled him, which revealed herself as a Clockwork Sorcerer, [[Oswald Beaumont]] then remarked on the fact that she was a Daughter of [[Mechanus]]. Sundara told the Duke that [[Solonor]] wouldn't like it if he killed her and to say hi to him. He told her that she would get the chance to tell him herself.

Sundara grabbed an unconscious Allara and teleported out of window into the air, slamming into the ground, while [[Oswald Beaumont]] stood at the window watching them.
