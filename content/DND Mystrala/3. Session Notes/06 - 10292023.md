## Events
The group travelled through the [[Delmiri Desert]] on the way to [[Alhadria]]. They made it to the Desert Oasis Inn, ran by Rasheed. They noted that it was not a safe time to be travelling in the area, but did not elaborate much more. The group was hired by Igor who lived nearby to get a troll out of his house and to fell him intact so that Igor could study it. After defeating the troll the group explored the nearby mausoleum. There a creepy dark force locked them in. Sundara found Daveed locked in a chest. After escaping the mausoleum and getting Daveed to safety, some of the group found a man overcooking his food in the middle of the desert. This man subsequently turned into an [[Oni]].
