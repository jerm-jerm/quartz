## Events
[[Samugi]] was found in a barrel of water. He planned an escape from [[Ironford Prison]] by hiding on [[Gunner Ironford]]'s [[The Icebreaker|ship]] in a barrel with a ton of potions of water breathing.

While sailing on the open seas, the group encountered Sahugain that attacked the ship. They defended the ship against the creatures, a priestess, and flying sharks.

The group decided to submerge the ship and head to [[Alhadria]] on foot, since they were fugitives and Alhadria has no extradition treaty.
