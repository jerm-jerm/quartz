There is a prisoner drop off happening today and as the group heads over they pull a water genasi out of an inky lake. This is [[Japheth]]. The group knew him before being sent to [[Ironford Prison]], but he now seems to have magic that he did not before. 

Laduguer members come off of the prisoner drop off ship and stab Gunner. A battle breaks out between prisoners, the Laduguer, and Gunner's people. The group take this time to narrowly escape the prison, after the loss of an acquaintance, Deckard. [[Cassius]] reveals that he is a changeling in an attempt to distract Gunner. Through a clockwork elevator that Sundara was able to operate using magic, they escape it into an underground cave. While communing with the device she senses that it was made by [[Solonor]].
