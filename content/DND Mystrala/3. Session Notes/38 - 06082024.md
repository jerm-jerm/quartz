## Events
In the morning the group wake up after the celebration at the Jaded Jackal. Varrick is awake first and witnesses [[Chalice Manath|Chalice]] leaving Sundara's room. At the bar he meets Modellin, a repo man with the FETC. He states that the group has inherited [[Gunner Ironford|Gunner's]] debt of 54,384 gold. Varrick tells him we aren't paying and to leave. He then goes to the [[Sea of Swords]] and talks with [[Sarah Stoneheart]]. He tells her about their past, she goes through waves of emotions before finally punching him and having to be held back by other Sea of Swords members. Varrick is escorted out, where Natasha finds him and then gives him a hug and starts crying.

The group returns to the ship for the reading of the last will and testament of Gunner. During this event the group meet [[Mira]] personally who has a creepy vibe, but otherwise seems uninterested in the group. Sundara finally confronts The Engineer and discovers --. They talk with Carter Abbyman regarding the meeting with the repo man and he says to not pay anything for the time being and that he will check on things personally. Additionally he offers a contract with the bank to find Ironsoul and deliver the staff.

At the request of Sundara the group plans to leave [[New Calim]] and go to [[Valendri]]. Before leaving Cassius meets up with [[Dunspero Beaumont]]. She initially seems reserved but warms up to Cassius who does the opposite and internally becomes more cold and stone faced. As they say goodbye, Cassius pointedly does not tell Dunspero that he loves her.

After talking with Mech-Bev, they drop the dark iron plating outside of the New Calim bay and take off for Valendri. After chatting and having dinner they learn of a stowaway on the ship. Natasha is in the kitchen holding a knife. Varrick talks with her and disarms her of most of her weapons. They send a message to Sarah who demands that Natasha return to her within 30 minutes or she will slowly tear Varrick apart. Sundara, Varrick, and Natasha teleport to the Sea of Swords. Sarah runs and grabs Natasha and then hugs her. She then runs up to hug and kiss Varrick. She is still furious and says that her plan is to find the people he signed a pact with and dissolve them and their entire circle. After she leaves Varrick hugs Sundara and starts to cry. Sundara can't find the right words to comfort him, but pats him on the backs. 

As she cast teleportation to return to the ship, in a way she has never witnessed before. They magic is completely sucked away. On the ship there are two loud thuds. Cassius and Allara run to the deck assuming a sky pirate attack, only to find two [[Phaerimm]] pulling themselves on board.
