## Events
After spending time in bed together, Cas and [[Dunspero Beaumont|Dunspero]] begin getting dressed for dinner. Dunspero admits to being a part of The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] in some contract for power. She reminds Cas that he didn't used to be such a team player, then ask Cas how important the group is to him, and eventually admits that The Circle is planning to kill Varrick tomorrow evening, at Barrowmoor. Additionally the witch who holds her contract will be there. She denies having invited them to the manor to help with this and says that she is willing to work alongside Cas whatever he decides to do.

Varrick asks Sundara to take him to [[New Calim]], while there he speaks with his ex-wife [[Sarah Stoneheart]]. He invites her to dinner and says it may be dangerous. She dons armor, weapons, and a beautiful dress in preparation. Natasha tries to sneak out of bed to come but Varrick turns her in to her mother. Sundara sends a message to Solonor asking him to come to dinner and he agrees.

All the parties convene at the manor. Sarah and Samugi get drunk quickly and before dinner even starts. Sundara pulls Solonor away for a walk before dinner. She asks to know the truth about how her and Solonor met and learns how he manipulated her. She also learns more about how he knew [[Karsus|Valender]] and his experience with the [[Phaerimm]]. They confirm their feelings for each other.

During dinner they are served and amazing multicourse meal while having awkward revelations and conversations such as:
- Samugi struggles to mage hand soup into his mouth and then finally succeeds
- How difficult Clockwork sentinels are to destroy and if they have hurt us before ("Well it sounds like you've all faced them numerous times and you're all quite alive so it looks like there's room for Improvement. That was a a joke of course, I'm pleased that none of my inventions have killed anyone... Well killed any of you." The memory of this was changed without the groups knowledge)
- The death of [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]]
- Sarah gets drunk and obviously is not a fan of how Dunspero is controlling the city
- Sundara ask Solonor if the sentinels could be made without living souls
	- They learn that [[Spark|tincture]] was an invention of [[Alexi Faraday]]
- Dunspero learns that Sundara is the granddaughter of [[Karsus]]
- Dunspero grabs with Cas' gun and playfully doesn't give it back, Solonor uses magic to return it to him


At the end of the night, Cas leaves when Dunspero attempts to spend the night with him. Instead he informs Sundara of the situation regarding Varrick and they come up with a preliminary plan. Sundara invites Solonor to stay the night at Barrowmoor Manor, but he instead teleports them to his cozy magical mountain hideaway where they spend the night together.
