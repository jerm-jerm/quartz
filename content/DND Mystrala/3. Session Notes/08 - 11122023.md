## Events
After talking with Rasheed about how dangerous [[Alhadria]] is, the group decided against traveling there. Rasheed set up for Daveed to be taken to Alhadria by his uncle Ishmael. Ishmael was in the process of smuggling goods for the [[Gilded Glave]] and needs help dropping the goods off in [[New Calim]]. The groups takes the goods along with [[Allara]] and plan on heading to New Calim.

[[Thaunia|Thaunia]] begins acting suspicious, similar to the [[Oni]]. She is seen eating overcooked meat. She confides in [[Sundara]] that she felt like she almost lost control during battle and that she was afraid of something. Some in the group also witnessed Thaunia avoiding the sight of blood.
