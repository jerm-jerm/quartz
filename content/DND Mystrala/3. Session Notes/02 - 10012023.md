## Events
The group met with Cassius' friends, including[[Varrick| Varrick "The Stack"]] and [[Briggs]]. We infiltrated [[Gunner Ironford]]'s office and found that he doesn't spend all of his time in prison and has a secret way out. We found documentation that [[Gunner Ironford]] is influencing the Church of Le Duegar and puppeteering the warden, he is supposed to go to trial and if found guilty will be executed. Multiple Shipstarting Scrolls were collected and stolen. [[Sundara]] collected a burnt letter off of Gunner's desk.
