## Events
The group met with Cassius' friends, including [[Varrick| Varrick "The Stack"]] and [[Briggs]]. We infiltrated [[Gunner Ironford]]'s office and found that he doesn't spend all of his time in prison and has a secret way out. We found documentation that [[Gunner Ironford]] is influencing the [[Church of Laduguer]] and puppeteering the warden, he is supposed to go to trial and if found guilty will be executed. Multiple Shipstarting Scrolls were collected and stolen. [[Sundara]] collected a burnt letter off of Gunner's desk.
