## Events
On [[The Icebreaker]] the group face off against [[Phaerimm]]. Sundara and Varrick return from [[New Calim]] through a teleportation spell stored in a ring into the middle of a battle. Overall, they note that the Phaerimm are resistant to many types of attacks, can predict the upcoming melee attacks against them, and consume spells cast nearby, along with other abilities that make them formidable opponents. As its dying action, one Phaerimm reaches out to Sundara telepathically and tells her, "I have tasted your magic before," with a dark and ominous hatred in his words. After destroying the two Phaerimm on their ship and dispelling the illusory Phaerimm, they approach [[Valendri]]. Sundara notices that some isles are smaller and some are missing entirely.

Griffin riders approach and shoot warning arrows at the ship. Allara cast protection spells in preparation for battle, but upon landing on the ship and seeing Sundara Archivist Thelion make moves to escort the ship onto the isles. They request she fully powers down the ship before taking them to her mother Solara. On the way, Sundara notices that the magical arcanotech that powers Valendri is inactive, they now are working by torchlight and bonfires, and it is not as pristine and polished as it once was. On reuniting Sundara and her mother Solara hug deeply, she tells her about their struggles with the Phaerimm, how Faraday has been helping by supplying weapons, and the loss of some of their best warriors, including Sundara's father, Cyndir. 

For safety reasons they have to relinquish their magical items. Upon touching the staff from [[Gunner Ironford|Gunner's]] Will meant for [[Ironheart]], Samugi has a vision. He sees himself running up the side of a colossus, presumably [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]], and using the staff to strike it down and bring it to it's knees. He then sees a monk in a sandy cave looking directly at Samugi before drawing a line in sand in what appears to be some type of challenge.

After discussing further with her mother and other Valendrian leadership Sundara learns more about the Phaerimm and her own ancestry. The Phaerimm have created tunnels under the islands and are sustaining themselves on the magical engines. There is a central hive with a Phaerimm Queen, but any who get too close fall under her spell and does not return. [[Alexi Faraday]] has been sending [[Psionic Weapons]] to help defend against them. Additionally, Sundara learns that Valender (a founder of Valendri) was her grandfather, and also went by the name, [[Karsus]]. He intentionally chose to embody Mystrala when he cast the spell, Karsus' Avatar, in disrupting the weave he starved and killed the Phaerimm, while the magic stored in the city of Valendri protected it from falling out of the sky.
