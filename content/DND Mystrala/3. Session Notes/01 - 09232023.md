## Events
Gunner Ironford the self-proclaimed ruler of [[Ironford Prison]] demanded that Cassius, Varrick, and Sundara collect a book that was stolen from him. In exchange he would give us a generous amount of tickets (currency of the prison). The group tracked the book to the owner of the Wager Pit. After trading his arm and some tickets, the group recovered the book, which appeared to be a manifest of prisoners along with their crime and the people that sent them in.
