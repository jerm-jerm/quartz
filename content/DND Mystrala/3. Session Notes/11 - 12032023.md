## Events
After killing the chimers, they then encountered a druid. Cassius held her with magic and [[Varrick]] knocked her out and tied her up. Varrick and [[Kazak]] tried to hurt her to get answers but [[Sundara]] and [[Allara]] stopped them. She wouldn't give any information or talk. Despite their best efforts, she escaped in the night. She caused Varrick to have nightmares reliving the moment of his son's death over and over again. Upon waking the group looked in the chest one of which contained alcohol. Varrick got drunk and grumpily stumbled down the mountain.

The remainder of the chest contained a custom build Restore lute, expensive linens, and Greenbottle Reserve halfling liquor. The group sold the liquor and told Bobby the Gent they completed the job. In exchange for completing the job they offered a [[Netherese Magic]] artifact that allowed [[Sundara]] to cast Sorcerous Burst.
