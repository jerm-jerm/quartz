## History
The Kalimoff family was THE skyship builders of essentially all of Karsus. On the maiden voyage of Reyna's current ship (previously her father's), The Reprisal, the entire family was murdered by sky pirates and the ship was lost. Because the family had died all of the assests went under the control of a business partner and then was taken over by The Queen of [[Brightwater]].

Reyna is "one of Xanders" and is what is known as an exarch, someone with unusual magical powers spawned from a sea demon.
