## Backstory
Varrick was previously a part of various groups including with people like [[Barrel Back Bill]]. He and [[Sarah Stoneheart]] had a son who was killed by a mage named [[Elhorn]] who shot off lightning in a tavern. Varrick went down a dark path, abandoning those from his past on a quest for vengeance.  He associated with the shady people of [[Restore Family|The Undertavern]] and was particularly good at dealing with magic users.

He was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] along with [[Cassius]] and [[Japheth]] after being caught breaking into [[Oswald Beaumont]]'s manor.

Recently learned that his ex-wife Sarah Stoneheart hid their child (5 year old daughter named, Natasha) from him because he was too unstable.

## Current Events
Dealt the killing blow to [[Oswald Beaumont]] ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

Was briefly cursed and attacked Sundara in a rage against all magic users ([[25 - 03092024|Session 25]]). He apologized and said he would do anything to regain her trust.

Recently sacrificed being remembered as a husband and a father for more power. Only he remembers being married and being the father to his late son and living daughter. ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). He does this so that the powerful enemies they make along they way can't target Sarah and Natasha, although he didn't know that he was specifically joining the suspicious circle. He was subsequently initiated into The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] in a battle to the death against [[Serpa]] ([[30 - 04142024|Session 30]]), and after his death he was revived. The Circle states that this process of being reborn through The World Tree connects them all. There appears to be some connection between joining the Circle, The Harbinger, and possibly The World Tree, but that is unknown currently.

Fought toe-to-toe with a young green dragon and held his own but was ultimately killed after being dropped 190ft ([[32 - 04282024|Session 32]]). While in the afterlife, Melana, The Queen of Rot, dug around in his chest before being banished by a champion of The Raven Queen. That champion turned out to be Varrick's son, who knighted Varrick into The Raven Queen's order ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

### Description and Characteristics
Large imposing goliath, shaved head, and beard. Wears full armor most often. Has multiple tattoos.

Tends to act first and ask questions later.

## Relationships
- [[Sarah Stoneheart]], his ex-wife, but becoming close again after reuniting in [[New Calim]], has yet to introduce Varrick to their daughter, Natasha; she now is unaware of Varrick's existence or their past relationship
- [[Barrel Back Bill]] and him appear to have a close friendship
- [[Briggs]], previously in a group together, but suspect some animosity as Briggs crawled up Varrick's back and stabbed him the first time they reunited in prison
- [[Sundara]], Varrick believes something special is going on with Sundara and his instinct is to stay close and protect her

## Secrets from the group
- He traded memories for power and made a warlock pact with an unknown patron. He has only told Cassius about the existence of his wife, daughter, and son
	- Met his son in the afterlife
