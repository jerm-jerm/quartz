## Backstory
Adopted as a baby by dwarf parents, was founds abandoned on a boat, knows nothing about his birth parents.

Varrick was previously a part of various groups including with people like [[Barrel Back Bill]]. He and [[Sarah Stoneheart]] had a son, Atlas, who was killed by a mage named [[Elhorn]] who shot off lightning in a tavern. Varrick went down a dark path, abandoning those from his past on a quest for vengeance.  He associated with the shady people of [[Restore Family|The Undertavern]] and was particularly good at torture and dealing with magic users.

He was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] along with [[Cassius]] and [[Japheth]] after being caught breaking into [[Oswald Beaumont]]'s manor.

Recently learned that his ex-wife Sarah Stoneheart hid their child (5 year old daughter named, Natasha) from him because he was too unstable.

## Prior Events
Dealt the killing blow to [[Oswald Beaumont]] ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

Was briefly cursed and attacked Sundara in a rage against all magic users ([[25 - 03092024|Session 25]]). He apologized and said he would do anything to regain her trust.

Recently sacrificed being remembered as a husband and a father for more power. Only he remembers being married and being the father to his late son and living daughter. ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). He does this so that the powerful enemies they make along they way can't target Sarah and Natasha, although he didn't know that he was specifically joining the suspicious circle. He was subsequently initiated into The [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] in a battle to the death against [[Serpa]] ([[30 - 04142024|Session 30]]), and after his death he was revived. The Circle states that this process of being reborn through The World Tree connects them all. There appears to be some connection between joining the Circle, The Harbinger, and possibly The World Tree, but that is unknown currently.

Fought toe-to-toe with a young green dragon and held his own but was ultimately killed after being dropped 190ft ([[32 - 04282024|Session 32]]). While in the afterlife, Melana, The Queen of Rot, dug around in his chest before being banished by a champion of The [[Raven Queen]]. That champion turned out to be Varrick's son, Atlas, who knighted Varrick into The Raven Queen's order ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

## Current Events

Revealed to the group that he has an ex-wife and children. Later went on to tell Sarah directly, during this reveal to her he heard a voice in his head telling him, "this isn't how this works." His warlock markings began to bleed and he felt poorly for the rest of the day. Sarah expressed that she was furious at him and was going to destroy the entire Circle of Ruin and Thistle.

Was chosen as a champion by Dagen after dealing the killing blow to the Kraken ([[50 - 09012024|Session 50]]) and pulling a magical trident of its eye. Dagen told Varrick his opinion (or possibly the truth) about The Raven Queen which Varrick chose to reject. The kraken, speaking through the trident requested taht Varrick build a shrine to him at the bottom of the ocean.
