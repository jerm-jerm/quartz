## Backstory
Varrick was previously a part of various groups including with people like [[Barrel Back Bill]]. He and [[Sarah Stoneheart]] had a son who was killed by a mage named [[Elhorn]] who shot off lightning in a tavern. Varrick went down a dark path, abandoning those from his past on a quest for vengeance.  He associated with the shady people of the [[Undertavern]] and was particularly good at dealing with magic users.

He was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] along with [[Cassius]] and [[Japheth]] after being caught breaking into [[Oswald Beaumont]]'s manor.

Recently learned that his ex-wife [[Sarah Stoneheart]] hid their child (5 year old daughter named, ???) from him because he was too unstable.
