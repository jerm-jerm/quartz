## Backstory
Grew up in the city of Valendri atop the [[Valendri|Skyshattered Isles]]. Left her family and her home after her coming of age ceremony. There were a lot of doubts among her people that her Trial of Future Visions truly encouraged her to leave. Sundara later learns that Solonor manipulated her trial to influence her to leave Valendri and join him.

She lived with and learned more advanced magic from [[Solonor]], but was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] by him when she began to explore more about the magic he was hiding. She is trying to discover more about her past, her abilities, and find ways to help her people who are being ravaged by the [[Phaerimm]]. All while grappling with the complicated feelings around Solonor, her desire for power, and trying to simply live in the moment.

## Prior Events
Refused to give [[Gunner Ironford]] the Shipstarting Scrolls for [[The Icebreaker]] resulting in the death of [[Billy the Boatswain]] (Sessions [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]).

Learns from Solonor that her sorcerous origin is of Mechanus and she is immortal ([[24 - 03032024|Session 24]]). She later learns that her origin of Mechanus comes from the founder of Valendri.

Reunites with her sister [[Elowen Elisthorn]] at a charity ball hosted by [[Alexi Faraday]] and after some tension the sisters exchange kind words. Sundara telling Elowen that she is happy for her and only wants to make sure she is safe. Elowen telling Sundara that when she was missing it was hard on the family, but she is proud of her and sometimes jealous of how easy magic comes to her (Sessions [[29 - 04052024|29]] and [[30 - 04142024|30]]).

Sundara meets with Solonor in her dreams after Faraday obtains the [[Pieces of The Inevitable|Harmonic Resonator]]. She admits that she has come to realize that what he has done for/to her thus far has been a large reason her magical potential has developed. Solonor appears interested that Sundara wants to become more powerful. She warns him of Faraday's plan regarding [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]]; he says he doubts Faraday has collected that many pieces and that he will handle it. Sundara begs him not to harm Elowen if she confronts him with Faraday and he agrees. At the end of the dream he takes her on a journey around Karsus, showing her the [[Delmiri Desert]], the frozen tundra of [[Kozah]] up north, and then over to The Serpentlord Shrine. Deep underground beneath the shrine she sees Solonor approaching a marble door (which she thinks leads to the heart of [[Karsus]]) with Faraday and a purple tiefling woman converging on him ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

Meets with The Clockwork Engineer, Anastasia, at the reading of Gunner's will. She learns that Anastasia started working with Solonor when Sundara left, inspired to leave after her Trial of Future Visions, but that she, "is not close enough to Karsus" to be anything more than an engineer. Anastasia is angry that Sundara doesn't know or respect Solonor's plans and that even though she left, in Solonor's eyes she is still talked about positively and seemingly, "can do no wrong." Sundara asks her about his plans and Anastasia says she has said too much. Before leaving she tells Sundara, "There is power in blood" a Valendrian saying ([[38 - 06082024|Session 38]]).

On the way up to [[Valendri]] via The Icebreaker, the group defeats a couple of Phaerimm. With its dying breath it telepathically tells Sundara in an unknown language, "I've tasted your magic before" and there seems to be ancient hatred in his words. After arrive to Valendri she learns she is the granddaughter of Valender whose other name was [[Karsus]]. With [[Pieces of The Inevitable]] and her blood right she could unlock his avatar and stop the Phaerimm, but likely risk many innocent lives in the process ([[39 - 06162024|Session 39]]). 

## Current Events
On her first visit to Valendri since she left, Sundara reunites with her mother and learns of how their home and people have been ravaged by the phaerimm. Her father was taken by the phaerimm on the last expedition to The Gardens and is likely in the process to become a host. Sundara ask for help from The Remnants to try and save him. While on their way, they meet Arnor in the Etherium District who voices his doubts about Sundara's Trial of Future Visions out loud and suggests a Truthseer should look into her visions. Later Sundara is forced into meeting the combined consciousness of the Phaerimm Queen and her grandmother Sundaria. Although the creature initially wanted to make Sundara truly immortal (possibly by turning her into a phaerimm) they instead make a deal with Sundara: if she can find them a new world to consume, they will leave her world intact (Session [[40 - 06222024|40]] and [[41 - 06282024|41]]).

Sometime later, while the group deals with a separate, but equally life-threatening problem, Sundara and Allara have a moment to talk. Sundara wants to confirm she is free from any possible [[Phaerimm]] sickness, Allara scans her and still senses traces of aberration within her.

Sundara invites Solonor for dinner at Barrowmoor Manor, their first meeting since she was sent to Ironford Prison. They reconcile. Solonor admitting that he hesitated before sending her to prison and knows that he can be cold and calculating and Sundara admitting that she has always felt pulled to him even when she was angry about what he had done. He tells her that she is more powerful and has a destiny greater than she can imagine.

- Her sister, [[Elowen Elisthorn|Elowen]], and her have a loving but occasionally tense relationship. Elowen feels she bears the burden of her people alone.

Sundara asked Solonor not to harm Elowen.
