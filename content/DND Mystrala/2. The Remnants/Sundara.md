## Backstory
Grew up in the city of Valendri atop the [[Valendri|Skyshattered Isles]]. Left her family and home and learned magic from [[Solonor]], but was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] by him when she began to explore more about the magic he was hiding. She is trying to discover more about her magic and find ways to help her people, while grappling the the complicated feeling around Solonor and helping those that have helped her along the way.

## Current Events
Refused to give [[Gunner Ironford]] the Shipstarting Scrolls for [[The Icebreaker]] resulting in the death of [[Billy the Boatswain]] (Sessions [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]).

Learns from Solonor that her sorcerous origin is of Mechanus and she is immortal ([[24 - 03032024|Session 24]]).

Reunites with her sister [[Elowen Elisthorn]] at a charity ball hosted by [[Alexi Faraday]] and after some tension the sisters exchange kind words. Sundara telling Elowen that she is happy for her and only wants to make sure she is safe. Elowen telling Sundara that when she was missing it was hard on the family, but she is proud of her and sometimes jealous of her magic (Sessions [[29 - 04052024|29]] and [[30 - 04142024|30]]).

Sundara meets with Solonor in her dreams after Faraday obtains the [[Pieces of The Inevitable|Harmonic Resonator]]. She admits that she has come to realize that what he has done for/to her thus far has been a large reason her magical potential has developed. She warns him of Faraday's plan regarding [[The Inevitable]]. Sundara begs him not to harm Elowen if she confronts him with Faraday and he agrees. At the end of the dream he takes her on a journey around Karsus, showing her the [[Delmiri Desert]], the frozen tundra of [[Kozah]] up north, and then over to The Serpantlord Shrine. Deep underground beneath the shrine she sees Solonor approaching a marble door with Faraday and a purple tiefling woman converging on him ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

### Description and Characteristics

## Relationships
![[SundaraFamily.png|left|200]] 
- Solonor, strained push/pull dynamic. Sundara has many strong feelings for him including admiration, anger, and attraction. She has admitted to him that most of her magical growth has been thanks to him, and that she wants to become more powerful before returning to him.
- Her sister, [[Elowen Elisthorn|Elowen]], and her have a loving but occasional tense relationship. Elowen feels she bears the burden of her people alone. She also knows about Sundara and Solonor and thinks Solonor is some type of leech on Valendri itself. Sundara wants Elowen to be safe and was hoping she would remain tucked away in Valendri. Sundara asked Solonor not to harm Elowen.
- [[Varrick]], has made efforts to protect Sundara since they were in [[Ironford Prison]] together. Sometimes she is put off or nervous about how well he seems to 'handle' magic users. But, outside of him being cursed or possessed, she trusts Varrick with her life. Is p bummed he just died.
