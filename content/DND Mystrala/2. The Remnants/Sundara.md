## Backstory
Grew up in the city of Valendri atop the [[Valendri|Skyshattered Isles]]. Left her family and her home after her coming of age ceremony. She lived with and learned magic from [[Solonor]], but was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] by him when she began to explore more about the magic he was hiding. She is trying to discover more about her magic and find ways to help her people who are being ravaged by the [[Phaerimm]]. All while grappling with the complicated feelings around Solonor and her desire for magical power.

## Current Events
Refused to give [[Gunner Ironford]] the Shipstarting Scrolls for [[The Icebreaker]] resulting in the death of [[Billy the Boatswain]] (Sessions [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]).

Learns from Solonor that her sorcerous origin is of Mechanus and she is immortal ([[24 - 03032024|Session 24]]).

Reunites with her sister [[Elowen Elisthorn]] at a charity ball hosted by [[Alexi Faraday]] and after some tension the sisters exchange kind words. Sundara telling Elowen that she is happy for her and only wants to make sure she is safe. Elowen telling Sundara that when she was missing it was hard on the family, but she is proud of her and sometimes jealous of how easy magic comes to her (Sessions [[29 - 04052024|29]] and [[30 - 04142024|30]]).

Sundara meets with Solonor in her dreams after Faraday obtains the [[Pieces of The Inevitable|Harmonic Resonator]]. She admits that she has come to realize that what he has done for/to her thus far has been a large reason her magical potential has developed. Solonor appears interested that Sundara wants to become more powerful. She warns him of Faraday's plan regarding [[Aurunat, The Inevitable]]; he says he doubts Faraday has collected that many pieces and that he will handle it. Sundara begs him not to harm Elowen if she confronts him with Faraday and he agrees. At the end of the dream he takes her on a journey around Karsus, showing her the [[Delmiri Desert]], the frozen tundra of [[Kozah]] up north, and then over to The Serpentlord Shrine. Deep underground beneath the shrine she sees Solonor approaching a marble door (which she thinks leads to the heart of [[Karsus]]) with Faraday and a purple tiefling woman converging on him ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

Meets with The Clockwork Engineer, Anastasia, at the reading of Gunner's will. She learns that Anastasia started working with Solonor when Sundara left, inspired to leave after her Trial of Future Visions, but that she, "is not close enough to Karsus" to be anything more than an engineer. Anastasia is angry that Sundara doesn't know or respect Solonor's plans and that even though she left, in Solonor's eyes she is still talked about positively and seemingly, "can do no wrong." Sundara asks her about his plans and Anastasia says she has said too much. Before leaving she tells Sundara, "There is power in blood" a Valendrian saying ([[38 - 06082024|Session 38]]).

### Description and Characteristics
Elf with short black hair and black and gold geometric markings on her face, neck, and arms. 

Can be hesitant to act when a straightforward, 'correct' course of action isn't clear. Doubts her abilities and power, but fervidly learning new magical skills and strengthening her current ones. Wants to be powerful.

Stresses about how she will age and the possibility/likelihood of being alone in the future. Is trying to take [[Chalice Manath|Chalice's]] advice and live in the moment.

## Relationships
![[SundaraFamily.png|left|200]] 
- Solonor, strained push/pull dynamic. Sundara has many strong feelings for him including admiration, anger, and attraction. She has admitted to him that most of her magical growth has been thanks to him, and that she wants to become more powerful before returning to him.
- Her sister, [[Elowen Elisthorn|Elowen]], and her have a loving but occasionally tense relationship. Elowen feels she bears the burden of her people alone. She also knows about Sundara and Solonor and thinks Solonor is some type of leech on Valendri itself. Sundara wants Elowen to be safe and was hoping she would remain tucked away in Valendri. Sundara asked Solonor not to harm Elowen.
- [[Varrick]], has made efforts to protect Sundara since they were in [[Ironford Prison]] together. Sometimes she is put off or nervous about how well he seems to 'handle' magic users. But, outside of him being cursed or possessed, she trusts Varrick with her life. Wants to explore the world trying weird juices with him.
	- Is upset that she has now watched him die twice
- Is immensely impressed and endeared by Chalice's loves for life and ability to live in the moment

## Secrets from the group
- She has always downplayed or skirted around discussing her feelings about [[Solonor]], will sometimes meet with him in the Clockwork Void or her dreams
- She detected something unusual when banishing [[Cassius]] to [[Mechanus]] 
- She thinks Serpa and Varrick may be related
