## Backstory
Grew up in the city of Valendri atop the [[Valendri|Skyshattered Isles]]. Left her family and home and learned magic from [[Solonor]], but was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] by him when she began to explore more about the magic he was hiding. She is trying to discover more about her magic and find ways to help her people, while grappling the the complicated feeling around Solonor and helping those that have helped her along the way.

## Current Events
Refused to give [[Gunner Ironford]] the Shipstarting Scrolls for [[The Icebreaker]] resulting in the death of [[Billy the Boatswain]] (Sessions [[22 - 02182024|22]] and [[23 - 02232024|23]]).

Learns from Solonor that she is not Valendrian, instead is of Mechanus and immortal ([[24 - 03032024|Session 24]]).

Reunites with her sister [[Elowen Elisthorn]] at a charity ball hosted by [[Alexi Faraday]] and after some tension the sisters exchange kind words. Sundara telling Elowen that she is happy for her and only wants to make sure she is safe. Elowen telling Sundara that when she was missing it was hard on the family, but she is proud of her and sometimes jealous of her magic (Sessions [[29 - 04052024|29]] and [[30 - 04142024|30]]).


### Description and Characteristics
Elf with short black hair and golden technicolor geometric markings on her face, neck, and arms. 

Can be hesitant to act when a straightforward, 'correct' course of action isn't clear. Doubts her abilities and power. Zealously learning new magical skills and strengthening her current ones. 

## Relationships
![[SundaraFamily.png|left|200]] 
- Solonor, strained push/pull dynamic. Sundara has many strong feelings for him including admiration, anger, and attraction. Recent visions of losing him pull at her heart.
- Her sister, [[Elowen]], and her have a strained relationship. Elowen feels she bears the burden of her people alone. She also knows about Sundara and Solonor and thinks Solonor is some type of leech on Valendri itself.
- [[Varrick]], has made efforts to protect Sundara since they were in [[Ironford Prison]] together. Sometimes she is put off or nervous about how well he seems to 'handle' magic users. But, outside of him being cursed or possessed, she trusts Varrick with her life.

## Secrets from the group
- She has always downplayed or skirted around discussing her feelings about [[Solonor]] 
	- She has talked with Solonor in her dreams and had recent interactions with him in the Clockwork Void
- She detected something unusual when banishing [[Cassius]] to [[Mechanus]] 
- She thinks Serpa and Varrick may be related???
