## Backstory
Grew up in the city of Valendri atop the [[Valendri|Skyshattered Isles]]. Left her family and home and learned magic from [[Solonor]], but was sent to [[Ironford Prison]] by him when she began to explore more about the magic he was hiding. She is trying to discover more about her magic and find ways to help her people, while grappling the the complicated feeling around [[Solonor]] and helping those that have helped her along the way.

### Description and Characteristics
Elf with short black hair and golden technicolor geometric markings on her face, neck, and arms. 

Can be hesitant to act when a straightforward, 'correct' course of action isn't clear. Doubts her abilities and power. Zealously learning new magical skills and strengthening her current ones. 

## Relationships
![[SundaraFamily.png|left|200]] 
- [[Solonor]], strained push/pull dynamic. Sundara has many strong feelings for him including admiration, anger, and attraction. Recent visions of losing him pull at her heart.
- Sister, [[Elowen]]
- [[Varrick]], has made efforts to protect Sundara since they were in [[Ironford Prison]] together. Sometimes she is put off or nervous about how well he seems to 'handle' magic users. But, outside of him being cursed or possessed, she trusts Varrick with her life.

## Secrets from the group

	- She has talked with Solonor in her dreams and had recent interactions with him in the Clockwork Void
