## Backstory
She serves the Raven Queen as a part of the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]]. The sisterhood creates potions and work at the Soulshard Apothecary.

Allara originally worked for the [[Gilded Glave]] transporting goods. She was transporting good in the [[Delmiri Desert]] when her entire group was wiped out. She blames herself for their deaths and works hard to ensure that the group she is currently travelling with doesn't meet the same demise.

Lost many of her sisters in the raid by [[Circle of Ruin and Thistle]] ([[15 - 01012024|Session 15]]).

Jumped from a 150ft tower, severely and permanently injuring her leg. The group takes her to an artificer who crafts a [[Clockwork Devices|clockwork]] leg for her (Sessions [[27 - 03242024|27]] and [[28 - 03302024|28]]). 

Met with her brother before leaving [[Karsus Folly]]. His contract was given to Xander to conduct occult investigations near Serpent Lord Shrine. He say that life in The Far Empire is not as bad as Allara thinks it is. He tells her that [[The Savage Seven|Mira]] knows all about Allara and would like to talk to her about working for her ([[31 - 04212024|Session 31]]).

Tried and was unable to save Varrick from death during the groups battle with [[Fern Shadow Forest|Rotgasp]] ([[32 - 04282024|Session 32]]).

- Mira (likely from [[The Savage Seven]]?) would like to talk to Allara about working for her and Allara would be owed a few years wages and would probably be paid what she is owed if she worked with her
