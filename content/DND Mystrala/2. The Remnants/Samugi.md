## Backstory
From an area north of Kozah. Knew a Demon [[Oni]] personally. Befriended it and then noticed he was becoming a reflection of the demon itself. 

## Current Events
The demon Oni that Samugi knew attacked him in the [[Delmiri Desert]] and told Samugi that he would take away what he found most precious. (Session [[06 - 10292023|06]] and [[07- 11052023|07]]).

Signed a lease for a shitty apartment in [[New Calim]] ([[13 - 12162023|Session 13]]).

Spent one night working at the [[Clockwork Devices|Clockwork Factory]] where the sentinels were made ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

Samugi spends time in battle tinkering with a Clockwork troll and starts to have a higher understanding of clockwork devices built by Solonor ([[26 - 03172024|Session 26]]).

Carrying around a large metal tube, the remainder of the group does not currently know what it does.
