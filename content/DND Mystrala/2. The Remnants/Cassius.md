## Backstory
His gift/curse of being a changeling was given to him by The Traveler.

Raised as a noble in a castle. His family owned a college in ?[[Brightwater]]? The college was taken over by Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]], who smeared the Manath family name and destroyed the institution. 

At some point Cassius become 'entangled' with [[Dunspero Beaumont]] and has maybe even considered marrying her. After breaking into the Beaumont manor with [[Varrick]] and [[Japheth]], Cassius was sent to [[Ironford Prison]].

## Current Events
Met The Traveler after having a Spark drink and identifying an object from ?another reality. While there he learned how to use his powers that are "in tune with creation." There he saw a young red tiefling wearing his face before witnessing the end of the world at the hand of The [[Phaerimm]].
