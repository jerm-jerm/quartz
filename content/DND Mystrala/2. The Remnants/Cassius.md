## Backstory
His parents prayed to the The Traveler during a time on struggle and were gifted Cassius a changeling child. He otherwise was presumed to be an orphan prior to becoming their child.

Raised as a noble in a castle. His family owned a college in [[Brightwater]]. The college was taken over by Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]], who smeared the Manath family name and destroyed the institution. 

At some point Cassius become 'entangled' with [[Dunspero Beaumont]] and has maybe even considered marrying her. After breaking into the Beaumont manor with [[Varrick]] and [[Japheth]], Cassius was sent to [[Ironford Prison]].

## Current Events
Helped in the battle of The Remnants vs Oswald Beaumont, stated he didn't want to kill him, but wasn't going to help him. Noticed Dunspero in the window of The Whispering Tower watching as Varrick dealt the killing blow ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

Met The Traveler after having a Spark drink and identifying an object, a twisted gun shaped weapon, from ?another reality. While there he learned how to use his powers that are "in tune with creation." There he saw a young red tiefling wearing his face before witnessing the end of the world at the hand of The [[Phaerimm]] ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). During that same event he finally revealed to the group that they had truly killed Duke Oswald Beaumont.

Cassius expressed concern that his sister Chalice might have gotten into some trouble as she hadn't been seen in quite awhile and divination magic was not working on her ([[31 - 04212024|Session 31]]).

On the death of his friend [[Varrick]], Cassius reaches out to [[Alexi Faraday]] offering [[Pieces of The Inevitable|Harmonic Resonator]] in exchange for help. After reviving Varrick, Faraday takes Cassius to [[The Shattered Spire]] and lets him take an artifact for a fair trade. Cassius takes the interdimensional twisted gun he examined earlier at the charity ball. Although the object feels inert he has the feeling that in another world it would have been an extremely powerful weapon, he decides to attune to the item  over a long rest ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

He meets up with Dunspero while the group is in New Calim, reuniting the Manath family. During the visit Dunspero initially seems cold and distant but warms to Cassius and kisses him. While dancing in the foyer of The Whispering Tower, Cassius hides his stone-cold face and then leaves without saying, "I love you" ([[38 - 06082024|Session 38]]).
