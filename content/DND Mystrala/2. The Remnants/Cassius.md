## Backstory
His gift/curse of being a changeling was given to him by The Traveler.

Raised as a noble in a castle. His family owned a college in [[Brightwater]]. The college was taken over by Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]], who smeared the Manath family name and destroyed the institution. 

At some point Cassius become 'entangled' with [[Dunspero Beaumont]] and has maybe even considered marrying her. After breaking into the Beaumont manor with [[Varrick]] and [[Japheth]], Cassius was sent to [[Ironford Prison]].

## Current Events
Helped in the battle of The Remnants vs Oswald Beaumont, stated he didn't want to kill him, but wasn't going to help him. Noticed Dunspero in the window of The Whispering Tower watching as Varrick dealt the killing blow ([[21 - 02102024|Session 21]]).

Met The Traveler after having a Spark drink and identifying an object from ?another reality. While there he learned how to use his powers that are "in tune with creation." There he saw a young red tiefling wearing his face before witnessing the end of the world at the hand of The [[Phaerimm]] ([[29 - 04052024|Session 29]]). During that same event he finally revealed to the group that they had truly killed Duke Oswald Beaumont.

Cassius expressed concern that his sister Chalice might have gotten into some trouble as she hadn't been seen in quite awhile and divination magic was not working on her ([[31 - 04212024|Session 31]]).

On the death of his friend [[Varrick]], Cassius reaches out to [[Alexi Faraday]] offering [[Pieces of The Inevitable|Harmonic Resonator]] in exchange for help. After reviving Varrick, Faraday takes Cassius to [[The Shattered Spire]] and lets him take an artifact for a fair trade. Cassius takes the interdimensional twisted gun he examined earlier at the charity ball. Although the object feels inert he has the feeling that in another world it would have been an extremely powerful weapon, he decides to attune to the item  over a long rest ([[33 - 05052024|Session 33]]).

## Relationships
- 'Entangled' with Dunspero Beaumont, a relationship that was presumably frowned upon by her father Oswald Beaumont, as he sent Cassius to [[Ironford Prison]] and requested that [[Gunner Ironford]] kill him once he arrive.
	- She was upset regarding the connection Cassius had to the death of her father, but reconciled this and her own disdain for her father
- Parents, [[Zariah and Anelia Manath]], they are performers, happy to be on the road and spend time together; generally supportive of Cassius and came to [[New Calim]] out of concern for him
	- His mother expressed disappointment to hear how blithely Cassius mentioned killing Oswald Beaumont 
- Adopted sister, [[Chalice Manath]], who he doesn't really talk to
