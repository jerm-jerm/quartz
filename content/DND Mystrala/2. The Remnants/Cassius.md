## Backstory
His gift/curse of being a changeling was given to him by The Traveler.

Raised as a noble in a castle. His family owned a college in ?[[Brightwater]]? The college was taken over by Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]], who smeared the Manath family name and destroyed the institution. 

At some point Cassius become 'entangled' with [[Dunspero Beaumont]] and has maybe even considered marrying her. After breaking into the Beaumont manor with [[Varrick]] and [[Japheth]], Cassius was sent to [[Ironford Prison]].

- Parents, [[Zariah and Anelia Manath]], they are performers, happy to be on the road and spend time together; generally supportive of Cassius and came to [[New Calim]] out of concern for him

- Adopted sister, Chalice, who he doesn't really talk to


## Secrets from the group
