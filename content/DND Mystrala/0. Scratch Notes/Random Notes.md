- Meeting Vitaly in the woods
Vitaly Dragonovick is following us in the forest and is from Drakomire. Says that [[Alexi Faraday]] is from there and was royalty. He escaped the war and hired Vitaly's father's ship but his father found something out (evidence is still in [[Langston]]) and had the entire ship killed. He wants to help us collect the [[Pieces of The Inevitable]] and keep them away from him. He doesn't know why he wants them.
