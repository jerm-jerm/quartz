The group explore [[The Icebreaker]]. Cassius finds a full kitchen crew working under the head chef, Bordon Ramley, a well renowned chef. On the ship they also meet Carter Abbyman, a banker on retainer, Jean Paul, the Ma√Ætre d', and an unknown Mr. Radler. 

[[Chalice Manath|Chalice]] recounts the events of the last few months. She went investigating after Cassius went missing while [[Ironford Prison]]. She discovered a larger conspiracy where the Queen of [[Brightwater]] used Duke [[Oswald Beaumont]] to infiltrate various systems utilizing [[Solonor]] and his [[Clockwork Devices]] to destabilize governments. All this in order to further the dominion of The Queen. Chalice tried to infiltrate the Beaumont home but was caught. She was kept as his prisoner for multiple months and ruthlessly interrogated until his daughter took over. The interrogations stopped until she was sent off to [[Ironford Prison]] where [[Gunner Ironford]] continued to interrogate her about the information she obtained. 

At a lovely dinner the group chats about aging,  immortality, Samugi's family (or lack thereof), and Allara's past. The group spends the remainder of the evening in the crow's nest drinking Greenbottle Reserve and watching the stars. Allara thinks about the [[Raven Queen]] and saving Varrick from death and Cassius swims in these memories in order to escape thinking about his own thoughts. Sundara thinks about her prior romantic feelings for Solonor and her thoughts drift to Chalice. She swims in her memories, Chalice initially recalls her time in prison and fighting to survive but then has an overwhelming feeling of hopefulness about the future. Samugi is thinking about a faceless Hangul gnome that he feels has been following him creepily. He wraps himself in his astral arms and through relaxing exercises meditates through the feelings. The group falls asleep under the night sky.

In the morning Cassius wakes up and goes to meet with the banker Carter Abbyman. He goes over Gunner's wishes on his death which includes bequeathing the deed of the ship and some other goods to the person who murdered him. Cassius also opens a bank account for the group under the name, The Expeditionary Reclamation Force, as well as a bank account of his own. 

The group goes to the brig and interrogates the halfling paladin that fought for Gunner. He never had any intention of working for Gunner. He and his partner were sent to investigate a sorceress in Yuan Ti country, an ally to Mira The Death Cleric, his cover was blown and they were captured as prisoners. She did something weird to his mind and he ended up working under Gunner, partially against his will. Allara and Cassius investigate the prisoners tattoo notice that it is a Curse of Surveillance, not the Ironford curse. Cassius starts to talk to whoever is listening in, but the group steps outside to discuss the next steps. With the plan to have Allara remove the curse they rush back into the brig to find a female with blood soaked blades in a forest through a gate spell. 

Allara begins the process of imbuing the ship with holy power to prevent unauthorized teleportation onto the ship. They find a specialized teleportation circle on the ship itself. Sundara enlist the help of Samugi for a [[Clockwork Devices]] experiment. Samugi tinkers into the engine room and creates a relay to help connect the Clockwork Sentinel to the The Icebreaker. Sundara communes with the grouped entity and meets Beverly Waverly for the first time, the soul that was originally used to create the Sentinel. Beverly is overwhelmed by the realization she is only a mind and the new expirence of being a ship. She takes control of The Icebreaker and begins to fly into [[New Calim]], firing the cannons once. Sundara talks her off the ledge inside the Clockwork Void, telling her that she and the rest of the group will work together to make sure what happened to her doesn't happen to anyone else and finding a way to free her soul if she wishes. Beverly gently lands the ship in the bay, and as the Sentinel introduces herself to the rest of the group. 

Leland, Briggs, Nick, and Dannyboy hop on the ship.

Cassius and Chalice reunite with their parents. 





Cassius goes down to the kitchen and hears thudding and yelling in the kitchen. Orc and prisoners in the kitchen, "Yes chef!" Bordon Ramley, famous, nay legendary chef from Orofin. He was a prisoner in Ironford. The kitchen has some serious upgrades. He had an agreement with Gunner to perform service for the different towns we visit for a service. Clockwork steam refrigerator. Essentially he needs exotic ingredients. They can prepare meals and if you find exotic ingredients, he can create a heroes feast. He can also do other feast for floating inspiration die depending on how much we invest. The way he moves, way more nibmle than Varrick, he is obviously able to fight in combat, looks similar to Vitaly (rouge) 

Ornately dressed blond haired moussed off (maybe a noble?) holding a bowl of hot food. Carter Abbyman, who represents the Bank of Aura, he was Gunner's banker. Wants to sit down for a chat for business items as part of his last will and testaments. He kept his assessts with the bank, but there are some hard assets, Kingslayer Clause. 

6 crew members under the chef, the banker (neutral policy tho), Mr Radler who is also on the payroll. (black suit and black tie, sliced back black hair) Jean Paul the waiter, he has been a waiter since longer than Cas has been alive. 

Cas went missing, found a larger conspiracy with the Queen of Brightwater user DOB to infiltrate other symptoms utilizing Solonor and his clockwork sentinels to destabilize governments to further the dominion of the queen and Chalice tried to infiltrate his home, kept prisoner their for some months, then his daughter took over. Interrogations stopped and then she shipped Chalice off to the prisons. Gunner interrogated her about the information she obtained. 


Mira the Death Cleric, the guy in the Brig knows something about her. "The godling made me see that I would be your prisoner" 
- armored halfing blond paladin
- had no intention of being under the employ of Gunner. Paladin of Helm with his partner to investigate. A sorcereress in Wuan Ti country (one of her allies) did something weird to his mind while he was a prisoner and he ended up working under Gunner and his goons 
blue shimmer behind the bars, eap of white armor in a dark and urky forrest. dark skinned lilve female soaked in blood as the gate slowly closes
I have seen this spell cast by Solonor before. Gate Spell. Was sent to the Underhoard Reformatory to watch Gunner.


Allara and her brother Thespir taken away from her home, by Mortimer Fitzroy adopted them and they had a nice life, was taught manners. Heard that she was going to be sacrificed and her brother helped her escape (faked her own death). The Raven Queen led her to the apothecary and that is how she became a part of the [[Voidwing Sisterhood]]. Her brother was training him to be her fathers bodyguard. Her brother was always being trained for something, and she wasnt trained for a specific purpose. Nothing then a ritual that failed. Her father was not religious as far as she new. Something about the talk of the Death Cleric Mira is causing some deja vu. 

Samugi's family has been dead for centuries. Was living in solitude for quite some time but now mostly alone. Middle aged. 

My mother has not aged at all, and she may be well over a thousand. Chalice recommends living in the moment, because elves take time for granted since they have so much time. 

Greenbottle Reserve: end up on the crews nest all together laying down watching the stars, look at someone and feel and see what they are thinking. Blunted but smooth. 

Emotion soup:

Allara - thinking about the [[Raven Queen]] and the glory of the palace. Seeing Varricks dead body on the floor and his son Atlas and can feel their desperation trying to pull him back against a pull of an otherworldly pact. Then a massive effigy of a god
Sundara -  starts thinking about Solonor and how they went from mentor to domestic romantic partners and starting thinking about Chalice.
Chalice - thinking about how she has been in prison and the darkness she went through and being interrogated by DOB and Gunner and quickly learning to survive and always being on the brink of survival and death everyday, but there is a lightness to her outlook and hopefulness. More than anyone I have ever met, this is someone who loves life and seeks to get the most out of every second. Brimming excitement about the future and possibility. 
Samugi - thinking about the hangul gnome, has been looking out for  a faceless old gnome, It Follows kind of fashion. Sees the face of the Oni from the oasis, there is some sort of cosmetically important lineage their. 

Ottoluke flying through the air. The group all sleep on the catwalk
