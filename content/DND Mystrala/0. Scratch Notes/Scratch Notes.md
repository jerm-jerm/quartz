Oberith -> Tinari -> Exarts

test before update

Varrick ask Ollie Silver for the bones, Ollie says they normally sell it to the sea witch an elf with caramel skin and burning eyes and dark hair that walks the waves. Possibly the person varrick talked to in his vision. 

Karken pieces are being loaded up into a warehouse to [[Bloodgulch Meatworks]]. Ollie Silver gives them blank stationary with a rune on the bottom (glowing stamp). And if you ever need assistance from the Rust Alley Whalers and prefer to be paid in a favor. 

While helping load up Kraken, Sundara ask about kraken processing. Most product has shifted to Bloodgulch meatworks that is owned by Bone Hunters, but they pay high jacked up fees to have the parts processed. They do have dealing with the Sea Witch who comes by and uses magic to 'use bones for witchcraft' she emerges from the sea and just walks back with the bones in tow. THey take the handcarts by rails to the workhouse, then use arcanotech primitive vehicles to meatworks to drop them off. 

Jank, whose has sorcerous blood on the female side, imagines leaving this life behind and naming his Daughter The Queen of Darkness and her being queen of brightwater and owning an island. 

Kraken wants Varrick to build him a shrine in his honor at the bottom of the depths of the ocean. Drakus, greatest of calamities. Varrick walks into the water and learns he can breathe underwater. Varrick says he needs to build a shrine in the depths of the ocean. Danny comes to pick us up.

Elhorn Kresnik, cursed kareken sword and zombie. 

Make it back to the Harbor Ghost Tower, has an open piece of parchment, stuff something into the parchment and closes it. Very regal and fancy seal, DB. Letter that is not addressed and is worded like she is making it seem that she doesnt know us. DB is inviting us to dinner at the Beaumont Estate. 

The next day we roll out of the tower towards the beaumont estate, disguised as a group of multiracial women. Walking down to the X, suspicious stuff, like slippery stairs, a weird crane eating a fish, regal looking dingy with middle aged man sitting in the back. 

Varrick approaches, Cas knows this as Cobb, the barkeep from brightwater that was the owner of his favorite tavern. He is working for Dunspero now and says he needs some help staying grounded. Barrowmor, small island north of Whitecrown, was an FETC farming colony and when the queen did what she did it became a stronghold and then when the dust settled it was a mass burial ground. Then the Queen gave it as a gift to DOB.

Arriving at the manor that is a nice and fancy and still quaint/rustic. She shows her brand while dispelling the magic.

As and Dunspero talk: offering us a place to stay (safe place) knows they dont have forever and the world is dangerous. Cas asks why she didnt give Chalice back and she says she was afraid of another person out there ready to destroy the family. Needed to establish a foothold in New Calim and that was her only use left for the queen. She says DOB wasnt supposed to die, he had failsafes but she sabotaed them so he wouldnt come back and if it wasnt for her, cas and all of his friends would have been dead. "your friend might have ***, but im the one that killed Oswald Beaumont."

Charms of the circle of ruin and thistle around the island. 

Sundara tries to ride Gambler, horesmaster Rami, young Delmiri elf. Varrick smokes in gnome clover in the kitchen.

Clockwork servers in the house, greetings in the voice of Oswald Beaumont. Sundara communes and they were made around the same time as the clockwork soldiers i am accustomed to, equiopped to defend, not quitte as versitle. No sentient. Powered by the sentient souls of tincture. No factory spec. 

They talk about who to bring to dinner. 

Barrowmoor Manor Langston

Dunsperpo and Cas talk and says forgiveness i dont think i can do that. and fade to black. 

Dunspero is offering us safe harbor in a place unbothered by the bonehunters, outsiide the riffraff of Langston. has the protection of her name and status but she doenst want us to throw that around. Teleportation circle for us to reconvene to visit friends, family, npcs that we left behind or left elsewhere. can leave to see them or bring them here to enjoy the luxure of barrowmoor. also have access to cobb who can ferry us around for activities in langston, cas knows cobb has a history and isnt useless if shit hits the fan. 


NEXT SESH

Dunspero and Cas chat. she admits to being a part of the circle and having a contract for power from a green witch The Circle is going to kill Varrick tomorrow evening (she calls him a vagabond and a murderer)

Varrick invites Sarah Stoneheart. Sundara sends a message to Solonor and hears a response. "I need you to show me the sigil." felt a second presence that was there and doesnt vanish. 

Solonor arrives, black and gold robes, lanky elf, messy, red hair. carrying bottle of wine and a single flower that is completely clockwork. Clockwork lotus, 12 petals that you can pluck and throw or consume the magic. 

Sarah has a constitution aura.

Dinner: Solonors 

faraday has eyes, solornor heart, mira veil, ottoluke leger, ironsoul silks, oswald chimes, gunner pelt

Cas - would like to go back home and have a family and be done with all of this

Per [[Dunspero Beaumont]] tracked down records from Five Fingers on Varrick, vagabond, murderer

Varrick trust sundara in general

Solonor to sundara, "your destiny goes far beyond anything the elders of valendri could ponder. they are seriously lacking in both perspective and imagination."
Valender wouldnt have subscribed to valenrian beliefs as they are now. He was not an isolationist. great elf, half human half elf disregarded but proved himself, they wre friends. no choice but to cast kasrus folly to save the world. true follow was saving sundaria
"but i understand not being able to kill a thing that you love"
wants a world of perfect harmony and order, no more entropy. would take hundreds of years of planning, research, aquiring artifacts. a powerful sorcerer, perhaps two very powerful sorcerers. restore balance
"yes its difficult to cause harm to that which you love"
"love is kind of a type of entropy if you think about it" I long for the day you leave all of this behind and embrace your destiny by my side
Solonor - obssesive, cruel, quick to make judgements
"I think you are far more powerful than I could ever be"
He's not amused with the changes ive made to mech bev and the ship

why did he step away when sundara cast a spell

wine from enclave vineyards. Cinod reserve. same one he shared with valender when he was an ambassador and valender was an apprentice

floating sorcery point

faraday invented tincture

Solonor said he moved onto other projects




Could the phaerimm and the oni be related somehow?? both consuming magical energy and items
Did Solonor know about the Solaria's phaerimm being kept by [[Karsus]]? was he the one that kept it hidden?
what was Solonor's plan for Valendri, he once said he had a plan to help the first time the phaerimm arrived, but they chose karsus instead? what was his plan and why did it leave him disgraced. is it a viable option now
He and Valender lived at the same time and knew each other.
Did Solonor know that I was Valender's granddaughter, is that why he chose Sundara? Was her trial of future visions a lie, did he influence it?
